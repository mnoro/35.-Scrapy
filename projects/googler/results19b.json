Concurrently the rating agency has assigned a Ba3 rating to the GBP250 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facilities (SSRCF) of Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited (Bidco), a B3 rating to the Senior Secured Notes totalling GBP1,900 million in the name of the company's subsidiary, Stonegate Pub Company Financing 2019 plc (Finco), and a Caa2 rating to Bidco's GBP400 million Second Lien Facility. Moody's changed the company's rating outlook to stable from developing and assigned stable outlooks to Bidco and Finco. A full list of affected ratings is provided at the end of this press release. RATINGS RATIONALE Today's rating action follows the launch of publicly listed senior secured notes totalling GBP1,400 million which will refinance the remaining bridge facilities used by Bidco to fund Stonegate's acquisition of Ei Group plc (EiG), which completed on 3 March 2020. The prospects for the company's credit quality were particularly uncertain in the wake of the rapid spread of the Coronavirus which led to a government requirement for all pubs in the UK to be closed from 20 March. Re-openings began in England on 4 July and this brings the prospect of a gradual improvement in Stonegate's profitability and cash generation. However, during the forced closure period the company endured a significant cash burn, even after taking mitigating actions such as furloughing staff and deferring all non-essential expenditure, including rent payments. As at 3 July the company had a cash balance of GBP96 million, down from GBP229 million on 30 March (in each case excluding cash within the ringfenced Unique Pubs perimeter). On both dates the company also had drawings of GBP175 million under its SSRCF, which in more normal times would have been undrawn. On the basis of pre-crisis pro-forma results for the twelve months to January 2020 and the debt quantum immediately post-close of the acquisition, the company's Moody's-adjusted leverage, measured as Moody's-adjusted debt to EBITDA, would have been high at more than 7.5x. Without the intervention of the Coronavirus crisis, Moody's believes that prospects for deleveraging would have been good, helped by expectations of continued solid underlying performance and GBP80 million of planned synergies. However, the length of time that it takes for the number of pub-goers to return to pre-crisis levels is uncertain and until that happens the company's ability to generate historic levels of earnings will be constrained. In its base case Moody's expects it will take until mid-way through 2022 before earnings growth results in Stonegate deleveraging to below 8.0x, albeit the rating agency highlights there are numerous factors that mean the pace of recovery could be slower or faster than in its base case. More positively, Moody's believes that the company's liquidity will remain adequate over the next 12-18 months. This assessment factors in the recent additional equity injection of GBP50 million and an equivalent increase in the level of the SSRCF, to GBP250 million from GBP200 million. Furthermore, the rating agency expects that Stonegate will take a prudent and measured approach towards capital spending, notably in respect of sites earmarked for conversion from leased and tenanted to the managed format. In addition, the rating agency's current expectation is that the company's shareholders would provide additional support to liquidity in the event that a second wave of the Coronavirus negatively affected Stonegate's operations. In addition to the risks already mentioned Stonegate's B3 CFR takes account of (a) the continuing competitive industry dynamics and the company's exposure to economic conditions in a single jurisdiction; (b) a highly leveraged capital structure which along with expansionary capital spending constrains free cash flow (FCF); and (c) execution risks around the scale of the EiG acquisition in particular in respect of planned synergies, notwithstanding the strong track record of Stonegate's management over an extended period. Story continues The CFR also takes due consideration of (a) the company's strong business profile which benefits from significant scale, wide geographic spread across the UK, and a mix between managed and tenanted pubs, with all of these attributes enhanced following the EiG acquisition; (b) a history of strong revenue and profit growth for Stonegate and solid pre-acquisition performance by EiG; and (c) significant scope for synergies to drive further earnings growth for the enlarged business. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS Moody's regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety. Stonegate is controlled by the private equity firm TDR Capital, which in common with other financial sponsors typically has tolerance for relatively high leverage in the companies it controls. However, more positively the rating agency expects TDR will continue to counter-balance this with a desire to ensure that Stonegate's capital structure is sustainable over the medium term. RATIONALE FOR STABLE OUTLOOK The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectations that Stonegate will maintain adequate liquidity over the next 12-18 months, with additional support from its shareholders if necessary. The outlook also assumes Stonegate will be able to achieve a gradual return towards pre-crisis revenue levels, which will facilitate some deleveraging as profitability also increases. FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS Although unlikely in the short to medium term, an upgrade could be considered if in operating conditions akin to the pre-crisis environment Stonegate is expected to achieve a sustained improvement in interest coverage to above 1.5x and leverage sustainably below 7.0x, combined with positive FCF and good liquidity. Conversely, a downgrade would be likely if the company's liquidity weakens or could be appropriate in the event of material delays in the return to pre-crisis operating conditions that bring into question the sustainability of the capital structure. Quantitively, a lack of progress in the next 12-18 months towards leverage improving to below 8.0x and interest coverage returning to above 1.0x would lead to negative rating pressure. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS All of the rated facilities are secured by a collateral package which includes share pledges, guarantees and debentures from Stonegate's material subsidiaries, with the exclusion of companies within the Unique Pubs sub-grouping, whose assets and cash flows are used to secure and service its ring-fenced bankruptcy remote securitisation facilities. An inter-creditor agreement regulates the relationship between the rated facilities. In its loss given default analysis Moody's has used a 50% recovery rate assumption, standard for capital structures which include a mix of bonds and loans. As such, the B3-PD PDR is in line with the CFR. The priority ranking of the SSRCF drives its Ba3 rating, three notches above the CFR and PDR. The Senior Secured Notes are rated B3, in line with the CFR, because the subordination cushion provided by ranking ahead of the Second Lien Facility is offset by the priority claims of the SSRCF in the event of a default. The Caa2 rating of the Second Lien Facility reflects its position at the bottom of the priority waterfall. LIST OF AFFECTED RATINGS: ..Issuer: Stonegate Pub Company Limited Affirmations: ....

Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology. CORPORATE PROFILE Stonegate is controlled by the private equity firm TDR Capital. Before the acquisition of EiG the company had grown via a number of acquisitions to become the largest privately held managed pub company in the UK, with more than 750 pubs under management. Separately with an estate of over 4,000 EiG was the largest leased and tenanted pub operator in the country, quoted on the London Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of around GBP0.9 billion prior to Stonegate launching its successful GBP1.3 billion equity bid last summer. The enlarged group had pro-forma reported underlying EBITDA (before IFRS 16) of GBP405 million in the twelve months to January 2020, approximately 65% of which was generated by EiG and its subsidiaries.

Shares in the United Arab Emirates' largest private healthcare company extended losses to touch session lows after the KKR announcement. By 1030 GMT, they were down 16% on the London Stock Exchange and set to lose half the gains made when NMC disclosed the approaches on Monday. NMC could not be immediately reached for comment on KKR's statement. NMC has been in turmoil since short-seller Muddy Waters queried its financial statements two months ago, sending its shares spiralling two-thirds lower. NMC disclosed preliminary buyout approaches from KKR & Co Inc and GK Investment on Monday. It said separately on Monday that its co-chair and founder BR Shetty had stepped back from its board after he informed NMC of potentially inaccurate reporting of his holdings. NMC, which listed in London in 2012 and was promoted to the blue chip FTSE 100 index in 2017, operates clinics and hospitals, specialized maternity and fertility clinics, and long-term care homes hospitals across 19 countries. GKSD, an investment vehicle backed by sponsors of Italy's private hospital chain Gruppo San Donato (GSD), said it was in the preliminary stages of considering an offer for NMC. GSD, founded https://www.gsdinternational.com/our-story.html in 1957, operates research hospitals, general hospitals and clinics in 44 locations across Italy and calls itself the country's largest private hospital group. GKSD is being advised by GK Investment, which made the approach to NMC on its behalf, the firm said. Rothschild & Co and Goldman Sachs are also acting as advisers. Lugano, Switzerland-based GK, focuses on investments primarily in Africa and the Middle East across multiple sectors. Historically, it has invested in oil service assets in Italy and the Middle East, its website http://www.gkinvest.com/en shows. Reuters reported https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nmc-health-m-a-exclusive/exclusive-two-groups-one-backed-by-chinas-fosun-bid-for-nmc-health-stake-sources-idUSKCN1VB20R last year that NMC was also the target of two groups, one backed by China's Fosun, looking to buy a 40% stake in it.

The move comes three months after NMC Health Plc, the London-listed holding company for the hospital group, went into administration in April after months of turmoil over its finances. The two sources told Reuters that NMC Healthcare LLC was looking at options to file under the jurisdiction of Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), which has its own laws relating to insolvency and corporate restructuring. Such a move would help create a framework for the recognition of debt claims while the administrators of NMC Health Plc finalise the scheme of arrangement with creditors, one of the sources said. A third source said the ADGM move is an option to obtain protection from the court from any enforcement proceedings from creditors, similar to Chapter 11 in the United States. A scheme of arrangement is a binding agreement about payment of all, or part of, a firm's debts over a period of time. The administrators for NMC Health declined to comment. The ADGM Registration Authority does not comment on its regulatory operations or disclose its engagements with external entities publicly, it said in an email. NMC Health is the largest private healthcare provider in the UAE, operating more than 200 facilities including hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. NMC's operating entities were unaffected by the appointment of administrators in April and services continued. That is unlikely to change as UAE authorities are keen to ensure hospital services in the Gulf state are not affected during the coronavirus pandemic, the second source said. NMC's implosion this year amid allegations of fraud and the disclosure of more than $4 billion in hidden debts has left some UAE banks and overseas lenders nursing heavy losses and prompted legal battles to try and recover money owed. The troubles began in December when short-seller Muddy Waters raised concerns over the company's financial statements and were compounded by doubts over the size of stakes of major shareholders, including founder BR Shetty.

NMC - which recently revised its debt position to $6.6 billion, well above earlier estimates - has seen its stock more than halve in value since December after short-seller Muddy Waters questioned its financial statements. Dubai Islamic Bank said on Sunday it has a $425 million exposure to NMC Heath, while its subsidiary Noor Bank has a further $116 million. The aggregate exposure to NMC constitutes approximately 0.7% of DIB's total assets as of March 31, the bank said. Shares in DIB were down 4.8% in afternoon trade after the disclosure, underperforming the Dubai stock index, which was down about 2.2%. Emirates NBD, Dubai's biggest bank, said it had an exposure of 747.3 million dirhams ($203.5 million), including 676.5 million linked to its unit Emirates Islamic Bank. The latest revelations came after Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, which has a $981 million exposure to NMC Health, said on Saturday it had asked a court in Britain to put the company into administration to safeguard its future. That process would give the healthcare group, whose London-listed shares were suspended in February, protection from creditors, and avert a more disruptive liquidation. NMC Health's new executive chairman on the same day called on the company's creditors to suspend debt repayments and said he would work with authorities in Britain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to recover misused funds. Shares of ADCB were trading 3.1% lower in afternoon trade. Other banks also made disclosures at the request of bourse operators in the UAE. Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank said it had extended $291.4 million in financing to NMC Healthcare LLC UAE, guaranteed by NMC Health, and that it had an additional $31 million exposure to Islamic bonds issued by NMC. National Bank of Fujairah pegged its exposure to NMC at 289.1 million dirhams, while Sharjah-based United Arab Bank said its exposure was 135.3 million dirhams. ADIB shares were down 4.9% on Sunday. Marie Salem, head of institutions at Daman Securities, said banks will have the opportunity to assess their exposure to NMC Health by June and take any action, such as writedowns, if necessary. DIB said it was now in discussions with NMC and its advisors to ascertain the group's financial position and identify potential measures to address its governance and financial issues.

London\u2019s top flight index closed the day down 19.06 points, or 0.27%, to 7,448.88. It fell slightly faster than France\u2019s Cac, which only just held above 6,000 points, 0.27% down, and the Dax in Germany, which fell 0.24%. It came as the pound regained some of its losses against the dollar, after hitting a two-month low last Friday. It rose 0.18% to 1.2915 against the greenback. Against the euro the currency gained 0.49% to 1.1836. NMC Health was the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest riser on Monday (NMC Health/PA) More A rise in the value of sterling often puts downward pressure on the FTSE 100, which is heavily weighted towards exporters. However, currency traders will now have their eyes on official statistics, due out tomorrow morning said Connor Campbell, an analyst at SpreadEx. \u201cThe pound may find its rebound tested on Tuesday morning. The first glimpse at the UK\u2019s Q4 growth is expected to come in at 0.0% against Q3\u2019s 0.4% \u2013 however there is some reason to believe the economy actually contracted by 0.1% in the fourth quarter,\u201d he said. Stock traders are still firmly looking at coronavirus, as Apple dropped 1% in New York, after reports that smartphone sales are expected to drop significantly because of the outbreak. \u201cThe bullish move of last week was mostly fuelled by the actions of Chinese state bodies \u2013 injecting liquidity, imposing shorting bans, and promising to cut import levies, but now that stock markets are left to fend for themselves, they are moving lower,\u201d said David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets. The price of oil fell 1.54% to 53.6 US dollars per barrel. In company news, shopping centre owner Intu was London\u2019s second highest riser as it notched up a 3.92p share price hike, or 29.25%, after revealing it is in talks with a major Hong Kong-based retail property investor. It ended the day on 17.32p. Intu, which is attempting to pay down its huge \u00a35 billion debt pile, confirmed talks have taken place with Link Real Estate Investment Trust, following a report in the Sunday Times. The company runs Lakeside in Essex and the Trafford Centre in Manchester. Despite Intu\u2019s astronomical rise, it was narrowly pipped by NMC Health to the top of London\u2019s risers. NMC was nursed back to health by the news that possible takeover might be in the offing. Its shares zoomed up the FTSE 100, adding 226.2p to 926.20, a stunning 32.31% rise. It came as the hospital group\u2019s chief executive was forced to stand down from the board and launch a legal review into exactly how much of the company he owns. The business has been in trouble ever since short-seller Muddy Waters in December released a report accusing NMC of misusing funds. Meanwhile, podcast business Audioboom, backed by property tycoon Nick Candy, has put itself up for sale, the company confirmed. Bosses at the group, which produces podcasts for 90 million listeners a month, added that financial advisers have been hired to seek out potential buyers. Shares pushed up 20p to 242.5p, or a nearly 9% rise. Urban Logistics REIT fell 5p to 144p as it announced plans to cash in on increasing demand for warehouses that can serve cities, as shopping habits continue to shift online. The company has announced plans to kick off a \u00a3100 million fundraising drive in a bid to raise the money it needs to buy \u00a3146 million of assets. The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 were NMC Healthcare, up 226.2p to 926.2p, Barratt Developments, up 24.4p to 823.8p, Compass Group, up 39p to 1,990p, British Land, up 10.8p to 570p, and Hargreaves Lansdown, up 30p to 1,634.5p. The biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 were Centrica, down 2.46p to 82.68p, Carnival, down 70p to 3,044p, Evraz, down 8.3p to 389.2p, Vodafone, down 3.04p to 150p, and Just Eat Takeaway, down 135p to 7,605p.

Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm glad we reconvene again to discuss our first quarter and first half of 2020. First, I hope you and your loved ones are all safe and healthy considering the event of time we are all living through. As you all know, we have reported our first quarter and first half results last week. Our profit were KWD 77.7 million for the first quarter and KWD 33.4 million for the second quarter. This led to first half profits of KWD 111.1 million, down 70 -- 47% compared to last year. Throughout the call, we will go into all the details behind the results, but let me start by briefly highlighting the main trends that affected our business as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and how we are coping with it and what to expect. Over the past few months, we faced many challenges on all levels. The COVID-19 virus outbreak hits us hard -- took us all by surprise considering nongovernment or business entities were prepared to deal with this scenario considering how the world is very integrated today. We have seen impact of the outbreak treading from one country to other, affecting businesses everywhere, while governments around the world have taken extreme measures in an effect to control the outbreak. These measures reflected very negatively on the economic activity and business sentiment globally. From business shutdown to curfew and Board disclosure, all these actions, along with change in sentiment created a severe shock to world economies with global GDP expected to contract by 5% during the year, the impact of the pandemic in GCC region was even more severe because of the large drop in oil prices and its impact on economic activity and budget deficits. In the first half of the year, most GCC countries have seen their physical position weakening with exceptionally large deficits projected for 2020. Our business was impacted in most of our locations leading to more challenging operating environment across our network. In Kuwait, the situation was not any different. The domestic economy was similarly [pressured]. The impact of the long period of lockdown has had its own stall of our operation as well. We are expecting this year's GDP to contract by around 6% because of the 4% contraction in non-oil activity. As you can see on the chart, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in Kuwait on February 24. This was followed by a consequence of government decisions that started with a business disclosure on March 9, and escalated to a complete lockdown during the month of May. Kuwait started a gradual opening of the economy in the beginning of June. And today, we are in Phase 3 of the 5-stage plan to return to some form of normal activity. From day 1, we have worked closely with the government and the Central Bank of Kuwait to provide support to the economy in a quick and efficient way and to support our customers in their financial needs. Moreover, we supported the government's effort to combat the spread of the pandemic by contributing to the KWD 10 million fund set by the Central Bank of Kuwait. We also donated KWD 1 million to Kuwait Red Crescent Society. In an early and swift response, the Central Bank of Kuwait initiated a macro prevention measure and reduced the regulatory requirement in an effort to increase the banking sector's resilience and enable it to play a more active role throughout the crisis. Most importantly, these measures included lowering the banking sector capital and liquidity requirements and dropping the discount rate to a historically low level, reaching 1.5%. Moving on to NBK. We took a proactive measure and activated emergency plan and very early -- at a very early stage of the crisis in order to protect our employees and to ensure business continuity. We move to following strict health and precautionary control to ensure safe environment for our staff and customers. Concurrently, we started leveraging the flexibility of our business model, providing support and active -- and advice to our customer-facing financial difficulties and relying heavily on our digital capabilities to maintain the level of service quality and accessibility that our customers would expect in normal times. In this context, I would like to extend my greatest appreciation to all our employees for their efforts and commitment during these challenging times. Separately, and without jeopardizing our future business plan, we initiated group-wide cost-cutting initiatives to reduce the impact of the pandemic on our profitability. On the customer front and in coordination with CBK, we participated in all initiatives aiming and realizing our customers and lifting some of that pressure they were facing. We extended support to SME sector by suspension of fees on POS terminals, ATMs and digital channels for 3 months. In addition to increasing the limit for contactless payments, moreover, providing support to individuals by deferment of customer loans, installment loans and credit card installments for a period of 6 months for all our customers. We have also provided support financing to individuals, SMEs and economic entities impacted by COVID-19 crisis. There is no doubt the first disclosure and slower economic activity, especially during the second quarter of the year, had significant impact on our operation. The drop in transactional volumes has resulted in lower fee and commission income, whereas the low interest rate resulted in more pressure on our interest margins. Additionally, the impact of non-oil GDP contraction, the lower oil price and the lockdown period has all increased the level of uncertainty around the cash flow outlook for many of our customers, which led to a higher provision charges as initially reflecting -- reflected during the reported period. Despite all these challenges, our balance strength remain intact. We are very confident that our strong capital base, comfortable liquidity levels and the quality of our profits will give us great capacity to observe the impact of COVID-19. To conclude on a positive note, I would like to point out despite all the challenges we have faced during the first half of 2020, the impact of COVID-19 also highlighted some great strengths of NBK. The strategic investments we made over the recent years, and most importantly, the ones led to the acceleration of digital banking services provided the bank with operational flexibility. Our digital channels delivered virtual alternatives to our branches, allowing us to serve our customers in the best way possible. Additionally, we are now very comfortable with our disaster recovery and crisis management practices that all proven very successful when tested during the early days of the outbreak. This all gives us more comfort as we move ahead towards the recovery phase, which we are very hopeful to see soon as the early signs were evident with some pickup in activity along with a gradual opening of the economy. With that, I will leave you now with Shyam to walk you through the financial of the first quarter and the first half of the year. Go ahead, Shyam. Thank you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Mr. Isam. Hello, everyone, and welcome. I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to take you through our results. Given that we did not publish our first quarter 2020 results owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and in line with the local regulations, this call would cover our results for first quarter 2020 and first half 2020. Therefore, for ease of reference of information in the relevant slides, I'll first cover the salient features of our half year results and then move on to the quarterly performance. We have announced first -- our first half year 2020 profit of KWD 111.1 million. This is a 46.9% decline in net profit over the comparable period last year. Before going into the fuller details, I would like to highlight that during first quarter 2020, the group, through its subsidiary, Boubyan Bank, increased its ownership in Bank of London Middle East, BLME, from 27.91% to 71.08%. And the group's financial results include the consolidation of BLME from first quarter 2020. Returning now to our financial results on Slide 1. We first look at the half -- first half 2020 net profit and its constituents. The net profit profile in the top left-hand side of this first slide at KWD 111.1 million for the 6 months to June 2020 was resilient. Given the significant impact of the challenging environment, we saw a drop in benchmark interest rates, lower economic activity affecting business volumes and elevated cost of risk. The 46.9% decline in net profit for the comparable period last year stems from 15% lower operating surplus, that is pre-provision and pretax earnings and higher impairments and provisions. I'll cover more on provisions and impairments later in the presentation. The operating surplus, profiled on the top right-hand side of this first slide, for the 6 months to June 2020 at KWD 260.3 million is 15% lower as compared to first half 2019. Income growth in the period was negative 8.3%, whilst costs grew by 5.8%. Operating income, profiled on the top right-hand side -- sorry, profiled on the bottom left-hand side of this first slide, for the 6 months to June 2020 at KWD 414.6 million, has been resilient throughout these unprecedented times, however, 8.3% lower as compared to first half 2019, primarily due to 7.5% lower net interest income and 9.1% lower fees and commissions. The decrease in net interest income was due to lower benchmark interest rates, notably 150 basis points drop in CBK discount rate from October 2019 onwards, partly offset by the growth in business volumes. The operating income mix is profiled on the bottom right-hand side of this first slide. 77% of our total operating income is in respect of net interest income and 23% from noninterest income sources. This mix is keeping in line with the previous year. Now we will go into the quarterly performance. I'll first cover second quarter 2020 and then first quarter 2020. Net profit for second quarter 2020, profiled on the top left-hand side of this first slide, was KWD 33.4 million, 57% lower on first quarter 2020. Net profit of KWD 77.7 million and 67% lower on second quarter 2019 net profit of KWD 101.4 million. The decline in net profit is primarily due to a drop in operating surplus and increased provisions and impairments. Operating surplus for second quarter 2020, profiled on the top right-hand side of the first slide, was KWD 117.9 million, 17.2% lower on first quarter 2020 operating surplus of KWD 142.4 million and 22.3% lower on second quarter 2019 operating surplus of KWD 151.7 million. As you can see, the second quarter 2020 was severely impacted by COVID, significant drop in benchmark interest rates, notably 125 basis points drop in Central Bank of Kuwait discount rate in March 2020 and drop in LIBOR levels, lower noninterest income due to slower pace of economic activity and benefit of lower costs. We'll see more on costs later in the presentation. The operating income for second quarter 2020, profiled on the bottom left-hand side of this first slide, was KWD 189.8 million to 3.6% lower on first quarter 2020, operating income of KWD 224.8 million, and 16.1% lower on second quarter 2019 operating income of KWD 226.3 million. As I referred to earlier, second quarter 2020 was severely impacted by COVID. Moving on to first quarter 2020 performance. The net profit for first quarter 2020, profiled on the top left-hand side of this first slide, was KWD 77.7 million, 27.9% lower on first quarter 2019 net profit of KWD 107.7 million, impacted by higher costs and increased impairments. The operating surplus for first quarter 2020, profiled on the top right-hand side of this first slide, was KWD 142.4 million, 7.8% lower on first quarter 2019 operating surplus of KWD 154.4 million due to higher costs. Operating income for first quarter 2020, profiled on the bottom left-hand side of this first slide, was KWD 224.8 million, only marginally lower as compared to first quarter 2019 operating income of KWD 225.6 million. I'd like to highlight that the year opened with much optimism and good growth, was [add] in respect of business volumes, transaction-driven business. However, the risks from COVID, heightened in mid-March, whereby Kuwait moved to a partial lockdown, similar to other regional and global markets. Later in the presentation, we will see first quarter 2020 growth in business volumes. Moving on to Slide 2. Here, we will look at net interest income performance and the growth drivers behind the performance. First half 2020 net interest income, profiled on the top left-hand side of the second slide, was KWD 318.5 million, 7.5% lower than first half 2019 net interest income of KWD 344.4 million. Net interest income has been reasonably resilient given the significant drop in interest rates, and this was offset in part from in the growth in business volumes. Interest-earning assets, profiled on the top right-hand side of this second slide, averaged KWD 28.5 billion during first half 2020, an increase of 8.3%. For first half 2019, the growth in interest-earning assets essentially reflected growth in our lending and investment volumes, the details of which we will look at shortly. We experienced contraction in our first half year 2020 net interest margin as compared to first half 2019. This was, in part, due to the timing effect on our book in respect of the decrease in the local discount rates that occurred in first quarter 2020. I'd like to add that our margins are negatively impacted relatively quickly in a declining interest rate cycle due to repricing characteristics of our loan book, while surmising the land impact on funding costs to take effect. If you look at the bottom left-hand side of the second slide, you will see that the net interest margin during the half year averaged 2.25%. This compares to an average margin of 2.64% in first half 2019. As you can see, the margins have been tighter at 2.09% in second quarter 2020, more so reflective of the dramatic drop of 125 basis points in Central Bank of Kuwait discount rate towards the end of first quarter 2020. On the bottom right-hand side of this slide, we can see the constituents that moved the average NIM downwards by 39 basis points from 2.64% in first half 2019 to 2.25% in first half 2020. The NIM was impacted negatively by the decline in benchmark interest rates with 34 basis points attributable to loans, 47 basis points driver assets, whilst the lower cost of deposits favorably influenced the NIM to the extent of 42 basis points. Now we will look at the quarterly interest income movements profiled on top left-hand side. The net interest income for second quarter 2020 at KWD 149.3 million, 11.7% lower than first quarter 2020, net interest income of KWD 169.2 million, 13.8% lower than second quarter 2019 net interest income of KWD 173.2 million. As I had alluded earlier, second quarter 2020 has been impacted by a drop in benchmark interest rates, lower economic activity impacting lending business volumes. The net interest income for first quarter 2020, at KWD 169.2 million, was marginally lower than first quarter 2019 net interest income of KWD 171.2 million. Now moving on to Slide 3. I will now speak about the group's noninterest income and its constituents profiled on the top left-hand side of this third slide. The total noninterest income in the first half year 2020 was KWD 96 million, 10.7% lower than first half 2019, negatively impacted due to slower pace of economic activity, following the shutdown since mid-March, and the impact of mark-to-market valuations on our investment book. First half 2020 also benefited from the impact of currency movements and our dollar AT1 bond issuances. The composition of the KWD 96 million total noninterest income is KWD 71.5 million in respect of fees and commissions income, KWD 25.6 million in respect to foreign exchange activities and net loss of KWD 1.1 million from other noninterest income causes. Fees and commissions was 9.1% lower than first half 2019. Our fees and commissions have been solid, given the backdrop of the challenging conditions and it's from a well-diversified pool of geographies and line of business. It's important to note that our major source of noninterest income is from core banking activity, more reflective of the trade flows and other consumer-related factors as opposed to more volatile income from trading activities. Now on the quarterly noninterest income movement. The noninterest -- total noninterest income for second quarter 2020 was KWD 40.4 million, 27.3% lower on first quarter 2020, noninterest income of KWD 55.6 million and 23.9% lower on second quarter 2019 noninterest income of KWD 53.1 million. Total noninterest income for first quarter 2020 was KWD 55.6 million, 2.3% ahead of first quarter 2019 noninterest income of KWD 54.3 million. It's important to note that first quarter was the strongest quarter, benefiting from the impact of currency movements in our dollar bond AT1 issuances, good consumer spending and trade flows and offset, in part, due to the negative impact of mark-to-market valuations on our investment book, while second quarter 2020 was impacted by the slower pace of economic activity. Moving now to operating expenses, profiled on the top right-hand side of this third slide. Total operating expenses in first half 2020 was KWD 154.3 million, 5.8% ahead of first half year 2019. This is a modest growth in costs, given our commitment to invest heavily in our businesses. Both front and back-end processes enabled the group to offer best-in-class service to its customers and to optimize our resources to improve operational efficiency. The first half year 2020 costs include COVID-related contributions, and I would like to remind what I had alluded earlier, that the group has now consolidated BLME. It's also important to note that first half 2020 includes the commencement of depreciation charge in respect of our new headquarters and the fuller impact of commissioning our state-of-the-art data center. Moving on to quarterly operating expenses on the top right-hand side of this first slide -- on this third slide. I'd like to highlight that the total costs in second quarter 2020 is KWD 10.6 million, 12.8% lower on first quarter 2020, resulting from actions to realign costs to reflect the lower levels of economic activity, albeit cost reduction will not entirely offset lower levels of income. Total costs for second quarter -- for first quarter 2020 at KWD 82.4 million is KWD 11.2 million, 15.8%, higher than first quarter 2019 cost of KWD 71.2 million, primarily BLME consolidation, COVID contribution, and impact of ongoing expansions in some of our key businesses and geographies. The group continues to invest in various digital initiatives, select product offerings in certain geographies, such as our wealth management business in Saudi, and to continue to improve our operational efficiencies, to new IT initiatives to drive long-term, sustained value to the group. The payback from our digital investments was evidenced during the crisis as the digital channels played a vital role in servicing customers with electronic transactions reaching to record highs. We do continue to press ahead with the expansion of our Islamic banking operations at Boubyan Bank and our operations at NBK Egypt. Therefore, we conclude on the subject of costs, I can say that our cost income ratio, as profiled on the bottom left-hand side of this first slide, is at 37.2%, impacted by lower income resulting from the rapid drop in interest rates and negative impact at the total income level from lower noninterest income. Moving on to provisions and impairments profiled on the bottom left-hand side of this third slide. Total provisions and impairments in first half 2020 is KWD 126.6 million, which is 88.7% increase in first half 2019, reflecting KWD 27.4 million impairment provisions. Notably, charge in respect of our investment book to cater for effects of volatility that may arise in anticipation of worsening macroeconomic factors due to the impact of COVID and in respect of our operations in Lebanon. Credit provisions, at KWD 99 million, include Kuwaiti corporates, Kuwaiti retail portfolio and a well-known international corporate customer at UAE. NMC Healthcare, that has been fully provided for and in part, covers accelerated charge in anticipation of worsening credit quality due to the impact of COVID. The aggressive credit provisioning for the 6 months to June 2020 at KWD 99 million was a charge of KWD 67.1 million in first half 2019, led to an increase in our cost of risk to 112 basis points from 82 basis points at the end of June 2019. The charge for second quarter 2020 was KWD 75.1 million was KWD 51.5 million in first quarter 2020 and KWD 35.7 million in second quarter 2019. Increased charge in second quarter 2020 reflects higher credit provisions, as elaborated earlier. The charge for first quarter 2020 was KWD 51.5 million, was at KWD 31.4 million in 2019 due to higher impairment charges relating to our investment book and for Lebanon. I'd like to stress here that despite elevated levels of provisions and impairments, the group's balance sheet remains strong with stable credit quality and capital. And because capital base, along with an ability to generate healthy operating profits, provide a strong credit loss absorption capacity. We will shortly look at the capital ratios in subsequent slides. Moving on to Slide 4. We will now review earnings diversification and the group. The operating income at our international operations for the first half 2020 was KWD 108.7 million, broadly on par with first half 2019. You will see from the pie chart on the top right-hand side of this fourth slide the contribution to group income -- group operating income from international operations was 26%, slightly up on the 24% of last year. The operating income from international has been resilient despite the unprecedented challenging times, however, the contribution from international operations reduced to 9% from 26%, essentially due to increased provisions and impairments, which I had referred to earlier, that is the provisions in respect of international corporate customer at UAE and impairment in respect of our investment book and for operations in Lebanon. As a result, the profit contribution was 81.2% lower than last year's corresponding number, which is profiled on the mid left-hand side of this fourth slide. The group's Islamic Banking subsidiary, Boubyan Bank, were also impacted by provisioning and delivered profits of KWD 17.1 million, 40.6% lower than the first half 2019 net profit of KWD 28.9 million. However, I'd like to highlight that the operating surplus at Boubyan Bank has been strong, with only a 3.1% drop versus first half 2019. Boubyan's share of assets increased to 21% of group, benefiting from the growth in loan and investment volumes, plus the consolidation of BLME. Finally, on this slide, we see that the profile of assets was such that the 44% of group assets were held at our conventional domestic operations in Kuwait, 35% at International and 21% at Boubyan. Although we see elevated levels of provisions and impairments, I'd like to stress that operating income is from a very well diversified asset mix, which is leading to NBK amongst Kuwaiti banks in terms of this geographical spread of operations, and due to its ability to conduct business in both conventional and Islamic banking. This diversification gives a significant degree of resilience to group earnings and provides what we consider as a strong competitive advantage to the group. Moving on to Slide 5. On this slide, we look at some of the key movements in volumes during the period. Total assets as of June 20 reached KWD 29.7 billion, is a 6.5% increase on June '19 primarily driven by strong growth in loan and investment volumes. Group lending is profiled on the top left-hand side of this fifth slide, increased to KWD 17.6 billion, a year-on-year increase of KWD 1.4 billion, 8.4%. This increase reflects the growth in Boubyan Bank and at our international operation. A significant part of this loan growth occurred in first quarter 2020. The loan book grew by 6.2% since the end of 2019. Also note that group loans include the KWD 150 million day 1 modification loss on consumer loan deferral for 6 months. I will revisit this more with more details under the discussion on capital. Customer deposits, profiled at the bottom left-hand side, at KWD 17.6 billion are KWD 2.1 billion, 13.6% ahead of June '19 and show a KWD 1.6 billion, 10.3% growth in the 6 months to June 2020. And just for purpose of clarity, please note that the customer deposits as defined here do not include deposits from financial institutions. This is in keeping with the presentation of customer deposits in our published financial statements. I would also like to draw your attention. An important underlying message is that within headline numbers, we continue to see a favorable movement in the group's overall funding mix. We experienced growth in core franchise deposits, noting in particular excellent growth in deposits at the retail and private banking arm of the group in Kuwait, both conventional and Islamic. The growth in retail deposits reflect a sustained focus on the deposit-gathering aspects of our business in recent times, [less] hedging, NBK's long-standing ability to capitalize on the group's strong brand, customer appeal and credit rating. The group's overall funding mix is profiled on the bottom right-hand side of this fifth slide. Customer deposits comprised of 70% of the total mix, which is higher than the June 2019 66%, driven by strong growth, as indicated earlier. I would like to highlight that a part of the significant growth stems from limited spending opportunities from -- for a major part of this half year and the consumer loan installment deferral. Further, the group also retired relatively expensive institutional deposits, whilst maintaining strong liquidity levels. I want to highlight that the group, despite the relaxation offered by the Central Bank of Kuwait, was able to maintain original mandated liquidity levels in Basel III ratios. Moving now to our penultimate slide. Here, we look at the impact of our financial results and on certain key parameters. The return on average equity in the opening half of this year was 6.3%, reflecting the impact of our lower profit in the first 6 months of the current year was at 13.1% in first half 2019 and to 12.3% for the financial year 2019. Similarly, the return on average assets of 0.75% was 1.53% in first half 2019 and 1.42% for the financial year 2019. Profitability ratios have been impacted by unprecedented drop in margins, certain fee income opportunities, given the lower levels of economic activity and elevated cost of risk. The total capital adequacy ratio, profiled at the bottom left-hand side of this sixth slide, at June '20, was 16.8%, was at 17.8% at the year-end December 2019, noting that the current year earnings are not factored into the computation of interim period ratios. The Tier 1 capital ratio on June '20 was 14.9%, while the CET1 ratio was 12.6%. The capital ratios was also impacted by KWD 115.4 million charge recognized in other comprehensive income during the 6 months to June 2020, being the net change in fair value of debt securities measured at every OCI. As regards to capital, it's important to draw your attention to the consumer loan deferral program. All Kuwaiti banks implemented a program to postpone installments and consumer and other installment loans and credit cards for a period of 6 months, effective April 2020, with cancellation of interest resulting from this deferral. The installment deferral resulted in a loss of KWD 149.9 million to the group from the modification of contractual cash flows. The Central Bank of Kuwait instructed banks to address the day 1 modification loss to equity. The equity charge in respect of this stood at KWD 130 million after adjusting the group's holding in Boubyan Bank. This charge will be equally phased up over 4 years starting 2020 for capital adequacy ratio calculation purposes. As regards asset quality, the NPL ratios increased from 1.1% in December '19 to 1.77% at June '20, given the aggressive credit provisioning that I had referred to earlier. The loan loss coverage ratio at the end of June '20 was 185.5% is at comfortable level. Before concluding, allow me to make a few comments on how we expect the full year to unfold. In the next slide, we will see the guidance. Generally speaking, the operating environment is challenging and it's tough to conclude as regards guidance on the key metrics. Of course, the guidance is after reconsideration as regards to timing and other factors which will get refined over time. As regards loan growth, loan growth in the 6 months to June '20 was 6.2%. We expect to see mid- to high single-digit growth for the 12-month period. The net interest margin averaged 2.25% in first half 2020, with second quarter 2020 closing at 2.09%, and we expect NIMs to be tighter for the rest of the year. Our cost-to-income ratio averaged 37.2% in first half 2020. We expect this ratio to remain around similar levels, influenced by a challenging rate environment and the macro landscape to go together with the continuation of our investment program in support of various group initiatives. We, therefore, guiding a cost-to-income ratio in the similar range to that of first half year 2020. Guidance on cost of risk is not included as we're still waging through the throes of the pandemic, and we're of the opinion that it is not prudent to give guidance. That brings to the end of my presentation. However, before handing back to Amir, I'd like to summarize by saying that we are satisfied with the results for the opening half of 2020, resilient operating income from domestic and international operations; upbeat lending in the opening quarter, although impacted in second quarter 2020 due to a slower pace of economic activity; good growth in core franchise deposits; reasonable cost growth, comfortable liquidity levels and solid capital base. The group continues with its strategy of investing in its people and in emerging technologies and selectively into reinforcing its geographic footprint in order to best protect the bank into the future. Looking ahead, we're hopeful that momentum will be back as restrictions are eased in a phased manner, and we remain optimistic of Kuwait's ability to lead a fast recovery, notwithstanding the various challenges and uncertainties. Thank you very much for your time. Now back to Amir. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Shyam. We know that the presentation is expected to be a bit longer, but we wanted to explain both quarters clearly. We'll pause for a minute to get different themes of questions, and we try to put them all together to -- for the sake of time to answer as many questions as possible. ================================================================================ Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [1] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. We've got a big list of questions, but there are similar ones. And frankly, there are a few questions on the modification losses as they're being referred to. And that's basically the impact from the postponement of the retail portfolio. So I'll just ask -- read one of the questions, and I will leave it to Shyam to explain it in more details what happens with the accounting treatment. The question is basically asking about -- asking to elaborate on the modification loss reported under the equity -- on the equity base. And if there's any impact on NII? Or just the drop in the second quarter NIM is mainly a result of assets yields declining. So we'll explain that in more details and the existing impact on equity and how that fits in the NII and the P&L. Shyam? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [2] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Thank you, Amir. With respect to the modification loss, the Kuwaiti banks came out with a program to postpone the installment of consumer and other installment loans, credit cards for a period of 6 months. This would mean that we need to compute the present value of the loans, which resulted in a modification loss of KWD 150 million. This modification loss, as instructed by the Central Bank, has been charged to equity, not to P&L. So the net interest system of the bank is productive -- it's not impacted because of this. Our equity charge has been booked currently after adjusting for Boubyan's KWD 130 million -- Boubyan's -- our holding in Boubyan, and this will be phased in the capital calculation, though starting from 2021. As regards to basis points drop that we talked about, it stems basically from the dramatic drop in interest rates. We had -- in first quarter, we had 2 big drops. One is the 25 basis points initially in the first week of March and then mid-March of about 125 basis points in NIM -- sorry, in the syndicate discount rate. And that's one of the reasons which led to the drop in NIM. As explained earlier, the loan books repriced faster, that is immediately, whereas we expect lagged impact of this on the funding cost over a period of time. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [3] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Question on NIM. What is driving 47 basis point drag on margin that you mentioned? Is this is due to other assets? Is this purely lower yields in international investments? Go ahead, Shyam. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [4] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. This is mainly driven by the wholesale assets that we have. This is in respect of our investment book, which is hedged. And also with respect to our wholesale activity and treasury. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [5] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another question on ECL. The question says, is the ECL charge of KWD 28 million covering NLC exposure fully? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [6] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The NMC exposure is covered fully, but not under ECL. It's part of the credit provision. As explained earlier, the ECL charge relates to the drop in fair value -- the drop in respect to our investment book and also with respect to our operations in Lebanon. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [7] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Currently, there are a couple of questions on guidance, and where do we see that going, and I think we covered that in the presentation. There is limitation to giving guidance on cost of risk at this point, considering how the operating environment is evolving and that the situation is not cleared yet. So hopefully, in the coming quarters, we'll have a clearer view on cost of risk by year-end. Question on dividends. Asking if we -- if NBK has a position on paying dividends at this point. And in the previous comments that were published on dividend in the market and the disclosures related to that. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Isam Jassem Al-Sager, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Group CEO [8] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, on the dividend part, I think it's too early to inform whether we will distribute any dividends or not. At the time, we are still in half year. The dividend is a function of earnings and capital and normally, this happens at year-end after we assess our closing capital position and future capital needs. Our priority will be to maintain our solid capital position with a proper buffer similar to what we have maintained over the years. The early announcement around the suspension of dividends distributed were all clarified by the Central Bank, while we maintain focus on banks that would benefit from the temporary low regulatory requirements set by CBK in response to COVID-19. Otherwise, the decision for dividend distribution should allow for normal approach being part of the capital plan at year-end. That's it. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [9] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We're just building again, just to take themes of questions because questions keep repeating. Okay. Another question on the increase in provisions in H1. And is it driven by the fact that some clients failed to pay their obligations? Clarify the number of them and who they are, if possible. Is NMC one of them? If you can comment about NBK disclosure on NMC? Do we expect NBK to continue similar level of provisions in Q3 and 4. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [10] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As regards NMC's very [recently] announced, NMC is a publicly disclosed -- exposures publicly disclosed to the Boursa. And said -- as I said earlier, that has been fully provided for. And with respect to full master of provisions, we did see our cost of risk in the previous years to normalize at around 82 basis points. Given the impact of COVID, we do see provisions in respect of our Kuwaiti -- some of our Kuwaiti portfolios with respect to costing and retail. And some of it is precautionary as well, just in case that we see -- we're still in the midst of the throes of the pandemic. So we expect some sort of integration in retail portfolio, which has been catered for. More or less, there is no big issues with respect to that we have seen specific credit quality. What we've seen today is only with respect to liquidity issues of corporate customers. We've not seen any deterioration in credit quality. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [11] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Questions on the losses through the fair value through other comprehensive income debt portfolio and the modification losses of KWD 149.8 million on the deferred loan installment. How do we reflect on CET1? And another question, why is it the international segment net income declined by 81%. I think we partially answered that, but we can elaborate a bit on it as well. Yes, Shyam? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [12] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. See the losses, which we see with respect to fair value for OCI debt portfolio is basically drop in the prices of bonds, which is factored into our CET1. However, modification losses that we see has been exempted from the cancellations plus the Central Bank of Kuwait. So they've given an allowance whereby this is factored into the company translation starting 2021 for a period of 4 years, starting 2021 to 2024. And then as regards to International segment, the net income declined by 81%, as explained earlier, this is mainly due to the impact of provisioning that we did with respect to our international bond portfolios and also with respect to Lebanon, and also with respect to NMC. NMC is a well-known international corporate customer based out of the UAE. And these are the reasons why we see a drop in the net income from International. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [13] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Another question on costs. You have mentioned implementing group-wide cost-saving initiatives. Can you please elaborate more on this? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [14] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Costs? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Isam Jassem Al-Sager, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Group CEO [15] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On the costs, since the early days of the crisis, we realized that the virus spread and the control measures implemented by the government around the world would have a negative impact on the bank's profitability. We immediately introduced some cost savings initiatives to be implemented across the group and efforts to ease the pressure on the bottom line. Our main target was to cut cost without cutting our strategic initiatives, our growth plan and our business execution capabilities. The most important initiatives we took is we freeze the headcount across the group. We reviewed the remuneration structure with more focus on reliable elements. And also, we reviewed all third-party vendor and suppliers contracts to be under control. I think that are the main initiatives we took to control cost. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [16] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. Question on -- relating to NIMs again, will the lagged repricing of deposits, deposit rates ease some margin pressure from 2.09% going forward. Shyam? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [17] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. The deposits that we have are relatively stable, and we do expect some benefit from repricing of these deposits in the coming quarters. However, we have given a very cautious approach as regards NIM because we are still in the midst of the pandemic. So we don't know what else is expected. But our liquidity levels are strong and where liquidity ratios are far better than even what we closed in December. So we do expect some benefit that will accrue to the group from lower funding cost in the next 2 quarters. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [18] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We're waiting for more questions to come in. There's a question on the news about intended government cutting its budget by 20% and how would that affect capital expenditure? And if there are any cancellations or delays in the expected mega projects? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Isam Jassem Al-Sager, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Group CEO [19] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I would say that in Kuwait, as well as other GCC countries, we will feel the pressure, not only from the spread of COVID-19, but also because of the drop on oil prices. Oil GDP and oil receipts remain a significant contributor to the country's GDP and to budget revenues. The moderate response to that would be budget cuts and a rationalization of spending. Unfortunately, capital expenditure will be among those planned cuts. And accordingly, we do expect some project delay, and we are witnessing some projects delay. And also, I -- on the other side, despite the negative trend we still saw some activity with the value of projects awarded in the first half of 2020, totaling about KWD 900 million. We are also hopeful that we can see some rebound in activity on the other execution side as well as awards with the planned gradual opening of the economy. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [20] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A lot of questions again on NIM, I think we got most of these questions. Question on NMC again and how the provisioning works for it. And that's accounted for, 100% covered. So we'll try to address that again. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [21] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. NMC has been fully provided for. It's provided in the credit provisions and fully provided for. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [22] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And there's also a question on provision coverage has fallen to below 200%. What level of provision coverage are you comfortable with? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shyam Kalyanaraman, [23] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The ratio currently is very comfortable. It's still at 185.5% and is at comfortable level. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amir Hanna, National Bank of Kuwait S.A.K.P. - Head of IR [24] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We're going through a big list of questions. But again, I think most of the themes have been covered. We don't see any questions that were out of our answer -- our response to previous questions. So we'll pause again for a minute, and if there are no more questions, we'll just conclude the call. Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

The British company's approach excludes any acquisition of NMC Health, the London-listed holding company that was placed into administration last month after months of turmoil, one of the sources said. Ashmore, whose private-equity arm focuses on healthcare sector, is among a number of potential bidders seeking a deal to run the hospitals, both sources said. The investor already has a presence in the UAE after King's College Hospital London was brought to Dubai through a joint venture with Al Tayer Group, Dubai Investments and Ashmore. NMC, which was founded by Indian businessman BR Shetty in the mid-1970s, became the largest private healthcare provider in the UAE but has run into trouble after short-seller Muddy Waters questioned its financial reporting and doubts emerged over the size of stakes owned by its biggest shareholders. NMC, which has borrowed from 80 local and international banks, disclosed $6.6 billion in debt in March, up from $2.1 billion in June last year. Ashmore and Alvarez & Marsal, the joint administrators of NMC Health, declined to comment. Interest in running NMC's hospitals comes after the administrators kick-started the process to sell NMC Trading, the holding company's distribution arm, sources said. In an internal memo sent to NMC employees late Thursday, the acting Chief Executive Officer Michael Davis said the hospital operator has been considering selling NMC Trading for quite some time. \"We have initiated the process and it is progressing well, which will reduce our working capital investment and ensure we are stronger financially,\" according to the memo. However, Davis denied media reports that NMC is also looking to sell other parts of its business. \"No decision have been made in this regard. If any such decisions are made, I will inform you directly at the appropriate time,\" he told employees. Davis said the company will be open and transparent with any affected individuals, as soon as a decision is made. A spokesman for NMC Healthcare confirmed it is in the process of exploring various options for NMC Trading (UAE), which it considers non-core. \"The management team's priority is to stabilise the business and ensure continuity of care at its hospitals and medical centres,\" the spokesman said in an email. NMC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on how many employees will be affected under the discussed plan. The group's distribution business is separate from its main hospital and medical centres business in the UAE.

The recent spate of mergers has concentrated exposures to the London-listed healthcare provider among some lenders while the scandal also raises questions over corporate governance standards in the UAE. NMC Health is a holding company for NMC Healthcare LLC and other affiliates, the largest provider of private healthcare services in the UAE. This comes as the \"one-two punch\" of COVID-19 and the low oil price will likely extend to credit markets, with potentially higher incidents of defaults, leading to worse asset quality among UAE banks, said Maria Elena Ponceca, a UAE-based portfolio manager. \"For the regional banks with exposure to the NMC Group this would mean even worse asset quality: higher Stage 3 loans, higher provisions, higher [risk weighted assets], higher cost of risk \u2014 ultimately eroding value: lower profits, lower book value,\" said Ponceca. According to Dubai Islamic Bank (PJSC), or DIB, as many as 80 local, regional and international banks have extended finance to the group, which has operations in 19 countries. DIB has large exposures to NMC, as do Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, or ADCB, and Emirates NBD Bank PJSC. Exposures among international banks include Standard Chartered PLC, with around $250 million, and Barclays PLC, with around $146 million. Doubts over accuracy of books In March, NMC Health reported it had found evidence of suspected fraud in its finances, following a report in December by Muddy Waters Research that raised doubts about the company's financial statements, including its asset values, cash balance, reported profits and reported debt levels. Its total debt ballooned to $6.6 billion, more than three times the $2.1 billion in debt it had previously declared in its official accounts. The High Court in London placed the company into administration on April 9 . With NMC no longer a going concern, this will reduce the recoverability and increase the loss given default ratios, said Jaap Meijer, managing director and head of equity research at Arqaam Capital. Whether creditors can be paid back \u2014 and when \u2014 will depend in part on the outcome of a thorough investigation of NMC's books of accounts to determine the depth of problems, said Krishna Dhanak, executive director at Alpen Capital. \"The timeline will be affected with the terms of debt restructuring of the group and/or a bailout of the group by a strategic player who sees value in the brand and operations over a long period,\" said Dhanak. He described the situation as \"a unique opportunity for strategic players to acquire a long-running diversified services healthcare group that built a powerful brand for itself in the region.\" Credit losses expected Most analysts expect credit quality among UAE lenders to worsen due to the economic impact of the coronavirus and the oil price despite measures by the UAE Central Bank to mitigate potential insolvencies. \"We think that the vast majority of banks will not have to resort to additional capital, and can absorb 7% loan loss charges in the next two years and a further 4% to 5% from excess capital, and can take in two years as much [in credit losses] as they took during the [global financial crisis] over the period 2008-2012,\" said Meijer. Banks may choose to postpone reporting their first-quarter results, said Meijer. The country's Securities and Commodities Authority has given all listed companies, including banks, the option to delay first-quarter results until their second-quarter results are due. ADCB, the country's third largest by assets, reported the largest exposure, totaling $981 million, to NMC, as well as an additional $181 million to Finablr PLC, a London-listed remittance holding also founded by Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, a well-known Indian businessman. That company is also in distress. The loans disclosed by ADCB were extended by ADCB, Al Hilal Bank PJSC and Union National Bank prior to the merger of the three banks on March 1, 2019, and together represent about 1% of the bank's assets, equivalent to around 80% of its 2019 net profits. Dubai Islamic Bank and its subsidiary Noor Bank both have significant exposures to NMC. Source: AP Photo Meanwhile, DIB has an exposure of $425 million, with an additional $116 million via its subsidiary Noor Bank PJSC, which was extended prior to its acquisition by DIB, the bank said in a statement to the Dubai bourse. The aggregate exposure constitutes approximately 0.7% of the bank's total assets. Other banks with significant exposures include Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC, with exposure of $291.4 million in addition to a $31.0 million sukuk exposure; and Emirates NBD with 747.34 million dirhams of direct exposure \u2014 676.46 million dirhams of this via Emirates Islamic Bank PJSC. Some smaller UAE banks also have significant exposures relative to their loan books: Commercial Bank International PSC, a bank in Ras Al Khaimah that is 40% owned by Qatar National Bank (QPSC), declared it has an aggregate exposure of 425.6 million dirhams, equivalent to 2.22% of net assets at end of year 2019, and almost four times its 2019 net profit of 111 million dirhams. Big name brands not immune to failure The NMC saga, coupled with the fate of The Abraaj Group, highlights concerns about corporate governance in the UAE. The Dubai-based private equity group was liquidated after it received a $315 million regulatory fine in 2019 for deceiving investors and misusing investor funds. Ponceca said the NMC case \"above all underscores how much more work is needed by Mid-East corporates to bring operational risk assessment and compliance up to par.\" \"[T]he dust has barely settled on the Abraaj case and here we are facing another corporate scandal. This does not bode well for the international investment community, who already has concerns about governance and transparency issues with this side of the world,\" she said. There is no doubt that investor confidence has been damaged, said Ali Al-Salim, a co-founder at Arkan Partners, a consulting firm dedicated to alternative investments. \"Investor due diligence in the region is not very sophisticated, we see it in the funds space too, people gravitate toward big brand names thinking they're somehow immune to failure. \"Blame however can't be saddled with any one party, it will likely be shared between directors, creditors, shareholders, regulators and auditors,\" he said. As of April 14, US$1 was equivalent to 3.67 UAE dirhams.

The rating agency downgraded NMC Health's corporate family rating to Caa1 from Ba2 and the company's probability of default rating to Caa1-PD from Ba2-PD. In addition, Moody's downgraded the company's $400 million trust certificates due 2023 to Caa1 from Ba2. The rating agency said the downgrade reflects NMC's growing governance troubles, which include its CEO's removal and CFO's absence. Moody's also pointed to issues in the Abu Dhabi-based healthcare provider's financial statements, including undisclosed supply chain financing agreements worth $335 million which were used by entities controlled by the company's founder B. R. Shetty and Khaleefa Butti Omair Yousif Al Muhairi, both now former executives. The rating agency also believes NMC no longer has reliable access to funding because of uncertainties in its available cash and the risk of losing the undrawn $400 million under its $2 billion revolving credit facility due to a change in control provision. NMC confirmed March 2 that its principal shareholders \u2014 Khaleefa Butti Omair Al Muhairi, Saeed Mohamed Butti Mohamed Khalfan Al Qebaisi and B. R. Shetty \u2014 no longer owned 30% of the business on a combined basis, triggering a change of control provisions under the original $2 billion credit agreement. Once triggered, lenders can suspend funds still available under the facility and demand repayment of issued credit. NMC has hired three advisers \u2014 Moelis & Co., PwC and Allen & Overy \u2014 to assist with discussions with its lenders, as well as to undertake measures designed to improve liquidity. The company is requesting an informal standstill with lenders in hopes they will not demand repayment of loans on an immediate basis. A Feb. 29 report from Bloomberg said Mubadala Investment Co. PJSC has been in early talks with NMC about a potential investment in the Middle Eastern healthcare provider.

The rating remains on CreditWatch with negative implications. The rating agency said the downgrade is based on its view of heightened risk of breaches of warranties and acceleration of payments under the company's senior debt facilities, as well as a possible cross default for its other outstanding facilities. Ratings noted that the discrepancies in audited financial statements recently announced by NMC following an independent review and the subsequent removal of the company's CEO Prasanth Manghat exacerbate the risk of default or acceleration of debt, which may happen in six months. The CreditWatch negative status is due to the possibility of Ratings lowering the Abu Dhabi-based company's long-term issuer credit rating to D/SD and affected issue ratings to D should a default occur. The agency also considers the possibility that NMC may fail to publish its audited financial statements within 120 days after 2020-end. Previously, Moody's downgraded NMC's corporate family and probability of default ratings , with plans to withdraw all ratings on the company due to issues related to corporate governance and financial statements.

The credit rating agency changed its outlook on NMC Health's BB+ rating to negative, indicating that it could be downgraded in the future. The outlook revision follows a sharp decline in the Middle Eastern healthcare services provider's stock price following a stake sale in the company by Vice Chairman Khaleefa Al Muhairi and second-largest shareholder Saeed Al Qebaisi. The sale came after a report by U.S. short-selling firm Muddy Waters LLC last month, accusing the company of a number of deficiencies. NMC responded to the report at the time by starting an independent third-party review of its business, though denied any wrongdoing on its part \u2014 calling the report false and misleading. S&P Ratings said the developments are likely to distract day-to-day management and add uncertainty to the company's future direction. The sale in particular can cause a change in the company's board and hence, a change in strategy. \"We believe the allegations and the sale could impair the company's access to financial markets and create additional uncertainty about its future direction and governance,\" the rating agency said. In its assessment of the company's business profile, the credit agency said NMC has a strong, long-standing reputation in the Middle East and receives its income from a diverse range of sources, although it is somewhat affected by private- and government-funded health care schemes. S&P Global Ratings expects NMC to continue making $180 million to $250 million of free operating cash flow in 2020 and 2021, which lines up with the BB+ rating. The company's rating will be downgraded if the company faces accounting issues, fraudulent activities or big changes to financial expectations in the next yearly results. S&P Global Ratings may revise the outlook to stable if the independent review deems NMC's accounting problem-free and the company's management is unaffected by recent events. The outlook may also be revised if NMC can generate positive free operating cash flow.

The troubled Middle Eastern healthcare services company has been embroiled in controversy since short-seller Muddy Waters LLC issued warnings regarding its accounting practices. In April, NMC was placed into administration by a U.K. court following an appeal by certain creditors of the company. According to NMC's lender Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, the joint administrators would carry out an investigation into the company's alleged irregular financial activities. NMC revealed in March that its debt position stood at about $6.6 billion. S&P Global Ratings believes the appointment of an administrator was a formalization of default, and the agency expects that NMC will likely not pay interest on its sukuk, an Islamic financial certificate, and convertible loan in the coming months.

The rating agency downgraded NMC Health's corporate family rating to Ba2 from Ba1 and the company's probability of default rating to Ba2-PD from Ba1-PD. Moody's said the downgrade is driven by the recent suspension of two board members of the company \u2014 Founder and Chairman B. R. Shetty and Executive Vice Chairman Khalifa Al Muhairi. The rating agency believes the board member suspensions reflect weaknesses in corporate governance and create uncertainty regarding NMC Health's strategic direction, noting that concerns have also developed over whether effective controls over the operations, including the integration of acquired businesses, have been adequately overseen and enforced. Moody's does not believe the company would be able to prioritize its focus on reducing leverage, which raises questions on its ability to access capital, in the short term. Leverage is a measure of debt a firm uses to finance its operations. The agency said the ratings are under review for a downgrade due to uncertainty regarding NMC Health's actual ownership, which could result in a change of control and an acceleration in the company's debt due to a syndicated loan facility agreement. Following a report from U.S. short-selling firm Muddy Waters LLC that accused NMC Health of a number of deficiencies, three major shareholders including Al Muhairi, a part of the Butti family, sold some of their holdings. On Feb. 10, Shetty said he is conducting a legal review to verify his shareholding in the company. If the review determines that the combined ownership of NMC by the KBBO group, which aggregates the holdings of the Butti family, and Shetty is below a certain threshold, it would trigger a change of control clause under the syndicated loan facility agreement. Moody's noted that, before the Feb. 10 announcement, the KBBO group and Shetty had a combined ownership of 42.7% in NMC Health, down from 58.7% after the unwinding of a series of margin loans. A change of control clause would only be triggered if any party, excluding the KBBO group and Shetty, holds more than 50% of the company's shares or if the KBBO group and Shetty were to hold less than a certain threshold under the loan facility. In its review, Moody's will assess whether a change of control clause has been triggered and the possible mitigation if the debt is accelerated. It will also review the strategic direction of the company, especially in case the board's composition changes, and the progress on deleveraging from the current high levels.

Inc. and Switzerland's GK Investment Holding Group SA. Following NMC's confirmation of the approaches, the company's stock price rose 9.03% to 763.20 pence as of 10:17 a.m. London time. The parties have not discussed any potential offer, Abu Dhabi-based NMC said in a Feb. 10 news release. KKR and GK each have until March 9 to make an offer. In a separate release, London-listed NMC said Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, its joint nonexecutive chairman, and his advisers are reviewing the holdings and interests held by him, Vice Chairman Khaleefa Al Muhairi and another shareholder, Saeed Al Qebaisi, as they may have been incorrectly reported historically. Shetty holds a 15.88% stake in NMC as of Feb. 10, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. Meanwhile, Al Muhairi owns an 8.82% shareholding in the company, while Al Qebaisi has a 1% stake. Al Muhairi and Al Qebaisi previously sold \u00a3375 million worth of the company's common stock, according to a Jan. 8 Reuters report. The share sale followed a report by U.S. short-selling firm Muddy Waters LLC accusing NMC of a number of deficiencies, which the company has denied. NMC said its board has asked Shetty, Al Muhairi and Al Qebaisi for clarity on the aforementioned issues, and to absent themselves from further board discussions until a decision about their roles as directors is reached.

Shares of the company fell to \u00a310.82. NMC, which owns and manages about 200 healthcare facilities across 19 countries, said in a Feb. 4 press release that it is unaware of any specific reason for the stock price fall. The company has been troubled by a report from U.S. short-selling firm Muddy Waters LLC accusing NMC of a number of deficiencies. Three key shareholders, including the firm's Vice Chairman Khaleefa Al Muhairi, have sold some of their holdings following the report. Muddy Waters' report primarily examined NMC's asset values, cash balance, reported profits and debt levels, highlighting possible overpayment for acquisitions. NMC has denied any wrongdoing on its part, calling the report false and misleading.

The UK\u2019s largest water supplier gave \u201ccareful consideration\u201d to joining the industry\u2019s first rebellion against Ofwat, in which three major water utilities plan to challenge the regulator. Anglian Water and Northumbrian Water have followed the lead of Yorkshire Water, which earlier this week became the first major water utility to call for the competition watchdog to intervene in the spat over profits. Yorkshire Water challenges regulator over price controls Read more The Thames Water board met to discuss whether to refer their own price regulation to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) before deciding that the process could lead to \u201csignificant management distraction\u201d while it works to improve its service. Thames has weathered multiple run-ins with the regulator in recent years over its poor record on tackling leaks and pollution . In the past the utility was accused of profiteering from its customers by paying out rich dividends to investors and virtually no tax. \u201cIt was deemed to be in the best interests of both customers and employees to accept the final determination, to ensure certainty in the months and years ahead, and to move forward positively and constructively,\u201d the company said. Ofwat sets the price controls every five years to decide how much money people should pay for their water and the level of service they should receive. This also determines how much profit utilities can make for their investors and shareholders. The dissenting firms claim Ofwat\u2019s price review could damage long-term investment in the sector by forcing companies to observe tougher industry targets while cutting spending and water bills. The plans could also lead to underinvestment in the UK\u2019s water system, which would pose a risk to customers and the environment, the companies have said. The CMA said it expects to take six months to rule on whether the price controls were fair but the inquiry could take longer. Kip Meek, the chair of the inquiry, said: \u201cEveryone needs water, so it\u2019s really important that customers\u2019 bills are not set too high, but at the same time the water companies have enough money to deliver an efficient and high-quality service. The CMA will look closely at whether Ofwat\u2019s decision strikes the right balance in this and other areas and will make changes if not.\u201d Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Last year Ofwat called for all water companies in England and Wales to cut bills for customers by \u00a350 over the next five years , while spending \u00a351bn on improving services and infrastructure. The industry had hoped to spend \u00a356bn to meet the new performance targets, which include plugging leaks and guarding against pollution, but this could risk higher bills for households. All other water companies have accepted the tough new Ofwat standards, including the listed water giants United Utilities and Severn Trent, plus Pennon\u2019s South West Water. Rachel Fletcher, Ofwat\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cSome investors have accepted this scale of ambition and change but others need to face up to the new reality. \u201cWe are ready to fully engage with the CMA, setting out our analysis and why we are confident this is the right settlement for customers, the environment and companies.\u201d Topics Utilities Water bills United Utilities Severn Trent Consumer affairs Household bills Water news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Parts of England could run out of water within 20 years, warn MPs Water firms not addressing problem of leaks, causing loss of 3bn litres a day, report finds Published: 10 Jul 2020 Parts of England could run out of water within 20 years, warn MPs Thames Water former boss handed \u00a32.8m since being sacked Steve Robertson received \u00a32m payoff on top of \u00a3777,500 for loss of notice despite being sacked over leakages Published: 5 Jul 2020 Thames Water former boss handed \u00a32.8m since being sacked England's privatised water firms paid \u00a357bn in dividends since 1991 Critics say utilities borrowing to pay shareholders instead of improving infrastructure Published: 1 Jul 2020 England's privatised water firms paid \u00a357bn in dividends since 1991 England's sewerage: what the water companies have to say Firms including Anglian Water respond to data on their practices and policies Published: 1 Jul 2020 England's sewerage: what the water companies have to say Severn Trent to spend \u00a31.2bn on protecting the environment Published: 4 Mar 2020 Severn Trent to spend \u00a31.2bn on protecting the environment Yorkshire Water challenges regulator over price controls Published: 10 Feb 2020 Yorkshire Water challenges regulator over price controls Water companies would be best advised to swallow their medicine Nils Pratley Published: 16 Dec 2019 Published: 16 Dec 2019 Water companies would be best advised to swallow their medicine UK water companies ordered to cut bills by \u00a350 by 2025 Published: 16 Dec 2019 UK water companies ordered to cut bills by \u00a350 by 2025 More more on this story Most popular Business Economics Banking Money Markets Project Syndicate B2B Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA The former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams is among those to have signed the letter. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent @ RupertNeate Published on Mon 27 Apr 2020 18.19 BST The government has dismissed a proposal from church leaders for companies that avoid paying UK taxes by routing \u201chuge profits\u201d through tax havens to be barred from taxpayer-funded coronavirus bailouts and support packages. Senior members of the clergy including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said that while vulnerable people were \u201cpaying the price\u201d of an underfunded and unprepared NHS, \u201csome large corporations continue to avoid responsibility, making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens\u201d. They urged the UK government to follow the lead of Denmark, Poland and France in refusing to provide state support to companies registered in tax havens. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, was challenged in the House of Commons on Monday by the Labour MP Peter Kyle about what the government planned to do about companies that had \u201cso aggressively avoided paying tax in this country\u201d. \u201cMany of those same companies are now relying on the largesse and generosity of taxpayers in order to remain solvent in these difficult times,\u201d said Kyle, who sits on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee. \u201cAs the chancellor starts to plan for the recovery economy, will he take this opportunity to have conversations with those companies to make sure that when we do recover they play a much fuller part in our economy going forward? Let\u2019s aim for not business as normal when we get back from this crisis, let\u2019s aim for business as better.\u201d Sunak said it was important that businesses act responsibly, but he did not set out any plans to bar tax-avoiding firms from state bailouts or the furlough scheme. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is right that during this process people act responsibly, and that is something I have urged all businesses to do.\u201d A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cThe aim of all our schemes is to support individuals and companies in the UK, and that is what they are doing, with millions benefiting from our grants, loans and the furloughing scheme. \u201cHMRC has robust tools to challenge businesses who avoid paying their fair share of tax. That is the right way to challenge avoidance, not by denying support to British workers who pay their taxes and would otherwise lose their jobs.\u201d Dear European colleagues! In Denmark we made a simple rule: If companies use tax havens, they don\u2019t get corona support from the government. Maybe something worth copying in your country? Listen to my Danish colleague @jacobmark_sf here. #covid19 pic.twitter.com/XrGdtDQ3Dc \u2014 Margrete Auken #FBPE (@MargreteAuken) April 22, 2020 A tax-haven-based pub and restaurant chain has taken advantage of the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme to furlough 16,500 staff. Stonegate, which is registered at PO Box 2681, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands , owns the chains Slug & Lettuce, Yates and Walkabout. A spokesperson for Stonegate Pub Company said: \u201cStonegate is a UK business, located in Luton, which pays its entire tax obligations in the UK including corporation tax, employee tax and VAT. Last year Stonegate paid over \u00a3300m in tax in the UK. As a UK business, fully paying UK tax, we have every right to access government assistance such as the furloughing support for our employees whilst our pubs are unable to trade due to Covid.\u201d The church leaders said in their letter published in the Times : \u201cDuring this crisis many of the most vulnerable people in our society are paying the price for a health and welfare system woefully unprepared for an epidemic. Meanwhile, some large corporations continue to avoid responsibility, making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens. \u201cMore than 80% of the British public believe that legal tax avoidance is morally wrong. This crisis demonstrates why they are right. Today at least $8tn [\u00a36.4tn] sits offshore, with its wealthy owners hiding from their tax and social responsibilities. Developing countries are deprived of up to $400bn every year by tax dodging.\u201d The letter was organised by the Church Action for Tax Justice campaign group and was signed by the Rev Dr Barbara Glasson, president of the Methodist Conference, the Rev David Mayne, moderator of the Baptist Union Council, and representatives from the United Reformed Church and Quaker movement. We can start reshaping the post crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they they are ending this practice. #SayNotoTaxDodgers https://t.co/jnPgrKKr6k \u2014 John McDonnell MP (@johnmcdonnellMP) April 24, 2020 John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said: \u201cWe can start reshaping the post-crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they are ending this practice.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has barred all companies registered in tax havens from applying for support from his country\u2019s \u20ac110bn (\u00a396bn) rescue package. \u201cIf your head office is located in a tax haven, it is obvious that you cannot benefit from public support,\u201d he said. Rune Lund, a Danish MP and Denmark\u2019s parliamentary tax spokesman, said: \u201cWhen we spend billions of taxpayers\u2019 money on saving companies and jobs, they need to go to that purpose and not get sent to a tax haven on the other side of the world.\u201d Sir Richard Branson\u2019s plea for the government to lend his Virgin Atlantic airline \u00a3500m has attracted considerable public and political criticism because he lives in the tax-free British Virgin Islands and has not paid personal UK taxes in 14 years. Branson is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person, with an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune . The letter does not name Virgin Atlantic or Branson, who owns 51% of the airline via his Virgin Group company. Virgin Atlantic is registered in the UK, but Branson\u2019s personal holding company, Virgin Group Holdings Ltd, is registered in the British Virgin Islands where there are no taxes. A spokesman for Branson declined to comment on the letter.

Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they\u2019re keeping staff and customers safe Jenny Stallard Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Melissa Timperley worked hard to make sure her salon still has a luxury feel while adhering to current guidelines.\nPhotograph: Shaw and Shaw/Guardian Melissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a \u201ctreat\u201d destination, she knows that everything \u2013 from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer\u2019s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee \u2013 makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience. And that isn\u2019t changing just because of lockdown rules \u2013 in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the \u201cnew normal\u201d. Based in Manchester, Timperley\u2019s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen. \u201cI think salon owners have two really important jobs,\u201d says Timperley. \u201cThey have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they\u2019ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.\u201d Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. \u201cThe whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,\u201d says Timperley. Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel. For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors. There\u2019s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that\u2019s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to show that you\u2019re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve staggered the appointments, we\u2019re opening longer hours and we\u2019re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who\u2019ve waited for us.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest Staff in the salon are wearing visors. Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/Guardian When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around. Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no \u201csharing\u201d of clients, but at other salons that\u2019s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley\u2019s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance. It\u2019s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country \u2013 wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too \u2013 all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government. For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company \u2013 which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others \u2013 opening up has also been a \u201cone day at a time\u201d process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen. Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust \u201cclosedown\u201d manual. \u201cWe\u2019ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I\u2019m glad we did as we\u2019ve had to activate that in Leicester,\u201d she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK\u2019s first local lockdown on 30 June. The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. \u201cWe communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we\u2019ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He\u2019s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what\u2019s going on. \u201cWe\u2019ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,\u201d explains Charlesworth. 'I'm so happy to be back': how Grind coffee is welcoming back its customers Read more Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. \u201cHundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you\u2019re off and we kept that updated,\u201d adds Charlesworth. Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business. And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G&T will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it\u2019s easier because then we\u2019re capturing customer data at the booking point,\u201d says Charlesworth. \u201cIf you come to the pub and you haven\u2019t booked, you\u2019ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,\u201d she says. \u201cThe wonderful thing about hospitality, it\u2019s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it\u2019s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it\u2019s like walking into the unknown.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Stonegate pub company is using a combination of screens, PPE, back-to-back tables and social distancing to adhere to the new lockdown rules. Photograph: Stocksy Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate\u2019s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,\u201d she explains. The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds. \u201cWhere it\u2019s outside we\u2019ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it\u2019s inside we\u2019ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We\u2019ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We\u2019ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we\u2019ve done.\u201d Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they\u2019re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings. Timperley says: \u201cEverything that we\u2019ve had to do differently, we\u2019ve done better. For example, the disposable towels are the nicest I could get, and the gowns are scented with vanilla. We\u2019ve tried to keep the luxury touches and as soon as we can introduce more back in, even if we can do a coffee in a disposable cup, that would make it feel nicer again. But I think people will just be so grateful to have their hair done, you know ... what I think has happened is people have tried cutting their hair at home and colouring their hair at home, and they realise how talented hairdressers are! \u201cI think the biggest challenge has been remaining positive in lockdown when everything around you is negative. For me, keeping the staff upbeat and the clients informed. Everything has been extra work.\u201d This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Senior members of the clergy including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said that while vulnerable people were \u201cpaying the price\u201d of an underfunded and unprepared NHS, \u201csome large corporations continue to avoid responsibility, making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens\u201d. They urged the UK government to follow the lead of Denmark, Poland and France in refusing to provide state support to companies registered in tax havens. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, was challenged in the House of Commons on Monday by the Labour MP Peter Kyle about what the government planned to do about companies that had \u201cso aggressively avoided paying tax in this country\u201d. \u201cMany of those same companies are now relying on the largesse and generosity of taxpayers in order to remain solvent in these difficult times,\u201d said Kyle, who sits on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee. \u201cAs the chancellor starts to plan for the recovery economy, will he take this opportunity to have conversations with those companies to make sure that when we do recover they play a much fuller part in our economy going forward? Let\u2019s aim for not business as normal when we get back from this crisis, let\u2019s aim for business as better.\u201d Sunak said it was important that businesses act responsibly, but he did not set out any plans to bar tax-avoiding firms from state bailouts or the furlough scheme. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is right that during this process people act responsibly, and that is something I have urged all businesses to do.\u201d A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cThe aim of all our schemes is to support individuals and companies in the UK, and that is what they are doing, with millions benefiting from our grants, loans and the furloughing scheme. \u201cHMRC has robust tools to challenge businesses who avoid paying their fair share of tax. That is the right way to challenge avoidance, not by denying support to British workers who pay their taxes and would otherwise lose their jobs.\u201d Margrete Auken #FBPE (@MargreteAuken) Dear European colleagues! In Denmark we made a simple rule: If companies use tax havens, they don\u2019t get corona support from the government. Maybe something worth copying in your country? Listen to my Danish colleague @jacobmark_sf here. #covid19 pic.twitter.com/XrGdtDQ3Dc April 22, 2020 A tax-haven-based pub and restaurant chain has taken advantage of the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme to furlough 16,500 staff. Stonegate, which is registered at PO Box 2681, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands , owns the chains Slug & Lettuce, Yates and Walkabout. A spokesperson for Stonegate Pub Company said: \u201cStonegate is a UK business, located in Luton, which pays its entire tax obligations in the UK including corporation tax, employee tax and VAT. Last year Stonegate paid over \u00a3300m in tax in the UK. As a UK business, fully paying UK tax, we have every right to access government assistance such as the furloughing support for our employees whilst our pubs are unable to trade due to Covid.\u201d The church leaders said in their letter published in the Times : \u201cDuring this crisis many of the most vulnerable people in our society are paying the price for a health and welfare system woefully unprepared for an epidemic. Meanwhile, some large corporations continue to avoid responsibility, making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens. \u201cMore than 80% of the British public believe that legal tax avoidance is morally wrong. This crisis demonstrates why they are right. Today at least $8tn [\u00a36.4tn] sits offshore, with its wealthy owners hiding from their tax and social responsibilities. Developing countries are deprived of up to $400bn every year by tax dodging.\u201d The letter was organised by the Church Action for Tax Justice campaign group and was signed by the Rev Dr Barbara Glasson, president of the Methodist Conference, the Rev David Mayne, moderator of the Baptist Union Council, and representatives from the United Reformed Church and Quaker movement. John McDonnell MP (@johnmcdonnellMP) We can start reshaping the post crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they they are ending this practice. #SayNotoTaxDodgers https://t.co/jnPgrKKr6k April 24, 2020 John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said: \u201cWe can start reshaping the post-crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they are ending this practice.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has barred all companies registered in tax havens from applying for support from his country\u2019s \u20ac110bn (\u00a396bn) rescue package. \u201cIf your head office is located in a tax haven, it is obvious that you cannot benefit from public support,\u201d he said. Rune Lund, a Danish MP and Denmark\u2019s parliamentary tax spokesman, said: \u201cWhen we spend billions of taxpayers\u2019 money on saving companies and jobs, they need to go to that purpose and not get sent to a tax haven on the other side of the world.\u201d Sir Richard Branson\u2019s plea for the government to lend his Virgin Atlantic airline \u00a3500m has attracted considerable public and political criticism because he lives in the tax-free British Virgin Islands and has not paid personal UK taxes in 14 years. Branson is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person, with an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune . The letter does not name Virgin Atlantic or Branson, who owns 51% of the airline via his Virgin Group company. Virgin Atlantic is registered in the UK, but Branson\u2019s personal holding company, Virgin Group Holdings Ltd, is registered in the British Virgin Islands where there are no taxes. A spokesman for Branson declined to comment on the letter.

Administrators from the consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal Europe were appointed in April to oversee the hospital operator, after an application from one of its biggest creditors, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. The bank has since begun criminal proceedings against an unspecified number of individuals at the company, which has been delisted from the London Stock Exchange and is now the subject of a UK accounting investigation .

They also stressed that all of the constituent members of the wider NMC Group, the largest private healthcare provider in the UAE, were continuing as previously. \u201cThis is a standard part of the formal process of administration for NMC Health Plc, the holding company that was listed on the London stock exchange, and does not in any way impact the ongoing trading of the wider group,\u201d said one of the joint administrators Richard Fleming. The administrators also said that, based on their current estimates, they anticipate the company\u2019s preferential creditors could receive a dividend of approximately \u00a31. NMC first came under scrutiny late last year when the US-based short-seller Muddy Waters criticised its financial statements.

The healthcare provider called in the administrators after the discovery of $2.7bn debt unknown to its board. Photograph: Jumana El-Heloueh/Reuters Julia Kollewe Published on Mon 4 May 2020 16.21 BST Britain\u2019s accountancy watchdog has opened an investigation into EY\u2019s audit of the scandal-ridden private hospital operator NMC Health, which collapsed into administration last month. The Financial Reporting Council said on Monday it began its investigation into the audit of NMC\u2019s 2018 accounts in mid-April. The Abu Dhabi-based company runs private hospitals in the Middle East and also owns the Aspen Healthcare chain in the UK. It called in administrators on 9 April after a board-commissioned investigation uncovered $2.7bn more debt than the board was aware of. The hospitals and medical centres are not included in the administration and continue to operate. EY, which is one of the big four auditing firms, said it would be \u201cfully cooperating with the FRC during their inquiries\u201d. The FRC investigation is piling further pressure on EY, which is also being investigated by the watchdog for an audit of Thomas Cook\u2019s accounts before the travel firm collapsed. The FRC aims to complete its investigations within two years. If it finds evidence of wrongdoing, it will transfer the case to a tribunal, which could decide on any penalties including fines, reprimands or ordering EY to review its procedures. The main City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, launched an investigation into NMC in late February, after shares were suspended from trading following the deepening accounting scandal at the hospital operator. Last week, Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, the Indian billionaire who founded the former FTSE 100-listed firm and resigned as co-chair earlier this year, blamed a small number of current and former executives for the alleged fraud. The turmoil at NMC began in December, when the short-selling hedge fund Muddy Waters flagged concerns over asset values, cash balance, reported profits, and reported debt levels, as well as possible fraud and theft. NMC denied those allegations. It is the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates.

The news of the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority came the day after Abu Dhabi-based NMC removed its chief executive and placed its finance chief on extended sick leave as its own investigation into its finances continues. NMC\u2019s shares have lost two-thirds of their value since the US-based short-seller Muddy Waters questioned its financial statements in December. The firm, which runs private hospitals and health services in the United Arab Emirates, has also admitted it is unclear who controls its biggest shareholdings . Healthcare empire NMC should be clear about who owns its shares | Nils Pratley Read more This week NMC shared details of an independent review of the firm\u2019s finances, led by a former FBI director. The review revealed that companies controlled by NMC\u2019s founder and another executive had accessed $335m (\u00a3260m) in secret financing since early 2018, without the knowledge of the company\u2019s board, and which did not appear on its balance sheet. The review found that companies which accessed the supply chain financing are apparently linked to NMC\u2019s founder, the Indian-born billionaire Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, and its major shareholder and former deputy chair, Khaleefa Al Muhairi. In a statement issued on Thursday, Muhairi rejected all allegations of wrongdoing and insisted: \u201cI have not been given a reasonable opportunity to engage with and assist the investigation with the benefit of the key documentation relating to the events in question, as I would have wished.\u201d The healthcare group said the FCA had agreed to a temporary suspension of its shares on Thursday \u201cto ensure the smooth operation of the market\u201d.

Photograph: Satish Kumar Subramani/Reuters NMC Health, which runs private hospitals in the Middle East, is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Photograph: Satish Kumar Subramani/Reuters Joanna Partridge Published on Tue 10 Mar 2020 19.52 GMT Troubled hospitals provider NMC Health has revealed it has almost $3bn more debt than it previously realised, as it continues to investigate an accounting scandal . The FTSE 100 firm, which is based in Abu Dhabi and runs private hospitals in the Middle East, said it had discovered more than $2.7bn in debt facilities which the company\u2019s board was not aware of and had not approved. It is in addition to the $2.1bn of debt it reported in June 2019. The company, which is listed in London but headquartered in Abu Dhabi, said in a statement: \u201cNMC is continuing to work with its advisers to understand the exact nature and quantum of the undisclosed facilities. The board believes that some proceeds may have been utilised for non-group purposes.\u201d The group has been in crisis for more than a month since it revealed accounting inconsistencies, including revelations over the ownership of shares , and has asked its lenders for an \u201cinformal standstill\u201d on its debt payments to avoid a cash crunch. Shares in the firm have been suspended from trading since the end of February, amid the expanding accounting scandal. The financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority , opened an investigation into the company\u2019s finances at end of the February, after the shares were suspended and the firm fired its chief executive, Prasanth Manghat, and granted its chief financial officer, Prashanth Shenoy, \u201cextended sick leave\u201d. The clearout at the top of the company came after a board-commissioned investigation by the former FBI director Louis Freeh found that the company had entered into $335m of secret financing arrangements that were used by entities controlled by Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, the founder and co-chair of the company, and Khaleefa Bin Butti, another of the main shareholders. The turmoil at the group was triggered after a December report by short-selling hedge fund Muddy Waters, which said it had concerns over asset values, cash balance, reported profits, and reported debt levels, as well as possible fraud and theft. NMC denied those allegations. NMC has hired investment bank Moelis & Company, accountancy firm PwC and lawyers Allen & Overy to advise on discussions with its lenders, and manage the company\u2019s finances.

Photograph: Jumana El-Heloueh/Reuters An NMC hospital in Dubai. Photograph: Jumana El-Heloueh/Reuters Jasper Jolly Published on Mon 2 Mar 2020 11.46 GMT Troubled hospitals provider NMC Health has asked its banks for an \u201cinformal standstill\u201d on its debt payments as it faces a cash crunch amid an accounting scandal. NMC, a member of the FTSE 100 index, said on Monday it was asking lenders to hold off from exercising their rights, which could include demands for debt payments or collateral, on the company\u2019s \u00a32bn debt pile. The London-listed company, which is based in Abu Dhabi and runs private hospitals in the Middle East, is in crisis after it revealed accounting inconsistencies, including revelations over the ownership of shares that could trigger the debt payments. The group, which treated over 7.5 million patients in 2018, reported revenues of $2.1bn (\u00a31.6bn) in the same year. It faces a cash crunch if its lenders call in the debts. The latest development was prompted by the admission that the combined stakes of the main shareholders: Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty, the founder and co-chair of the company, Saeed Mohamed Butti al-Qebaisi and Khaleefa Butti al-Muhairi , had fallen below 30%. The terms of NMC\u2019s debts include \u201cchange of control\u201d provisions \u2013 including a requirement that the principal shareholders own more than 30% of the business between them \u2013 that allow the banks to call in their loans with only five days\u2019 notice. NMC has hired investment bank Moelis & Company, accountancy firm PwC and lawyers Allen & Overy to advise on discussions with its lenders as well as managing the company\u2019s finances. The Financial Conduct Authority last week opened an investigation into the company after trading in its shares on the London Stock Exchange was suspended and the company fired its chief executive, Prasanth Manghat, and granted its chief financial officer, Prashanth Shenoy, \u201cextended sick leave\u201d.

Photograph: Jumana El-Heloueh/Reuters NMC Health is struggling to cling on to investors after Carson Block\u2019s Muddy Waters Capital alleged inaccuracies in its financial reporting. Photograph: Jumana El-Heloueh/Reuters Published on Tue 11 Feb 2020 12.51 GMT W hen at war with short-sellers, especially Carson Block\u2019s feared US outfit Muddy Waters, a company\u2019s best defence is credibility. Another chunk disappeared at NMC Health on Monday as the hospital operator and member (for now) of the FTSE 100 index said its shareholder register could be wrong. NMC was merely relaying information from Bavaguthu Raghuram Shetty but, since he\u2019s the founder, co-chairman and public face of the United Arab Emirates-based firm, all parties should be squirming. Some 20m of the shares held by Dr Shetty, equivalent to a holding of almost 10%, could in fact be beneficially owned by his two Emirati partners, Saeed Mohamed al-Qebaisi and Khalifa Butti al-Muhairi. The 77-year-old Shetty is a \u201cvisionary leader who follows his heart and intuition\u201d, according to his NMC biography, but sadly stock exchange rules don\u2019t allow room for doing your own thing. Basic stuff like the division of ownership among controlling shareholders is meant to be reported correctly. We\u2019re not talking about a trifling sum. NMC\u2019s shares have plunged 60% since Muddy Waters launched its blistering analysis of the company\u2019s financial condition in December, but 20m shares are still worth \u00a3185m. One should also note that, according to NMC\u2019s statement, some of the shares in question have been transferred to banks and \u201cmay also be subject to security arrangements\u201d, meaning pledged as collateral. That detail is important because the two Emirati partners last month sold a slug of NMC shares to repay loans. The rump of NMC\u2019s beleaguered board has done what it can. It is \u201curgently seeking clarity\u201d from all three shareholders about how many of their shares have been pledged as security. In the meantime, Shetty and Muhairi, who both sit on the board, have been suspended from directors\u2019 duties. As an advert for the London\u2019s supposed high standards of governance and transparency, the saga looks dreadful. NMC is a FTSE 100 company, so is stuffed into a lot of UK savers\u2019 pension pots, and it boasts three blue-chip advisers in the form of Barclays, JP Morgan Cazenove and HSBC. NMC has denied the Muddy Waters\u2019 allegations from the outset, launched an internal investigation, and now says it has received \u201chighly preliminary\u201d bid approaches from US buyout giant KKR and Swiss firm GK Investment. The latter element pushed the share price from 800p to 926p on Monday and a takeover, if it happens, would spare the London market from further embarrassment. Come on, though, Monday\u2019s tale of potentially misleading disclosures looks bad enough already. The Financial Conduct Authority says it is \u201cmaking inquiries with the relevant parties\u201d. One hopes it\u2019s being less gentle: insist on answers, not least from the cast of high-profile advisers. At last, some fireworks as Ofwat faces overdue scrutiny Exciting times for water wonks: one of the large privatised firms is so enraged by regulator Ofwat\u2019s proposed price controls for the next five years that it will challenge them formally. Yorkshire Water is within its rights to summon the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) , but the last time a similar-sized firm did so was the mid-1990s. It is virtually impossible from outside to tell if Yorkshire has a decent technical case when it says Ofwat\u2019s stance \u2013 a function of many detailed calculations \u2013 would discourage long-term capital investment. One can, though, say it\u2019s excellent news that we\u2019ll see some CMA action. Public faith in the water industry and its regulator is low and Labour\u2019s nationalisation plans were popular for a reason. Customers have seen too many instances of companies delivering substandard service while showering dividends on their owners. Scrutiny by a specialist team at the CMA could be a useful air-clearing moment. Remember, the CMA won\u2019t just consider Yorkshire\u2019s plea that the regulator has been too harsh; it is free to rule that Ofwat should have been tougher. In fact, it would be helpful if Yorkshire is joined in the appeal lounge by others. Thames and Northumbrian are the likely candidates and have until the end of this week to decide. The more, the better: a showdown could be exactly what\u2019s required to determine whether a broader revamp of regulation is necessary. Intu makes slow progress, but must aim higher for equity boost Intu, the beleaguered owner of Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex, is making progress. It now has the name of a potential outside volunteer to chip in a few quid to support a mammoth fundraising effort \u2013 Hong Kong-based Link Real Estate Investment Trust. The open question, though, is whether \u00a31bn-\u00a31.5bn, the rumoured target for the equity injection, will be enough to repair a horribly stretched balance sheet. The bears say twice as much is needed. Intu, if it can, needs to aim high.

Simply Wall St February 4, 2020 To the annoyance of some shareholders, NMC Health ( LON:NMC ) shares are down a considerable 41% in the last month. That drop has capped off a tough year for shareholders, with the share price down 59% in that time. All else being equal, a share price drop should make a stock more attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. So, on certain occasions, long term focussed investors try to take advantage of pessimistic expectations to buy shares at a better price. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors\u2019 expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. See our latest analysis for NMC Health How Does NMC Health\u2019s P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers? NMC Health\u2019s P/E of 10.39 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. If you look at the image below, you can see NMC Health has a lower P/E than the average (22.6) in the healthcare industry classification. LSE:NMC Price Estimation Relative to Market, February 4th 2020 Its relatively low P/E ratio indicates that NMC Health shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. If you consider the stock interesting, further research is recommended. For example, I often monitor director buying and selling . How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios P/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the \u2018E\u2019 in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases. NMC Health increased earnings per share by an impressive 24% over the last twelve months. And earnings per share have improved by 26% annually, over the last five years. With that performance, you might expect an above average P/E ratio. A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The Bank It\u2019s important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won\u2019t reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth. Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio. Is Debt Impacting NMC Health\u2019s P/E? NMC Health has net debt worth 54% of its market capitalization. If you want to compare its P/E ratio to other companies, you should absolutely keep in mind it has significant borrowings. The Verdict On NMC Health\u2019s P/E Ratio NMC Health\u2019s P/E is 10.4 which is below average (18.0) in the GB market. The company has a meaningful amount of debt on the balance sheet, but that should not eclipse the solid earnings growth. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low. What can be absolutely certain is that the market has become significantly less optimistic about NMC Health over the last month, with the P/E ratio falling from 17.5 back then to 10.4 today. For those who don\u2019t like to trade against momentum, that could be a warning sign, but a contrarian investor might want to take a closer look. When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If it is underestimating a company, investors can make money by buying and holding the shares until the market corrects itself.

Simply Wall St January 5, 2020 To the annoyance of some shareholders, NMC Health ( LON:NMC ) shares are down a considerable 33% in the last month. Indeed the recent decline has arguably caused some bitterness for shareholders who have held through the 33% drop over twelve months. All else being equal, a share price drop should make a stock more attractive to potential investors. While the market sentiment towards a stock is very changeable, in the long run, the share price will tend to move in the same direction as earnings per share. The implication here is that long term investors have an opportunity when expectations of a company are too low. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth. Check out our latest analysis for NMC Health How Does NMC Health\u2019s P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers? We can tell from its P/E ratio of 17.67 that sentiment around NMC Health isn\u2019t particularly high. If you look at the image below, you can see NMC Health has a lower P/E than the average (23.9) in the healthcare industry classification. LSE:NMC Price Estimation Relative to Market, January 5th 2020 This suggests that market participants think NMC Health will underperform other companies in its industry. Since the market seems unimpressed with NMC Health, it\u2019s quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares , because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued. How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios Probably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That\u2019s because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the \u2018E\u2019 in the equation. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up. NMC Health increased earnings per share by an impressive 24% over the last twelve months. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 26% per year over the last five years. This could arguably justify a relatively high P/E ratio. Don\u2019t Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank Deposits The \u2018Price\u2019 in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. So it won\u2019t reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth. Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context. How Does NMC Health\u2019s Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio? NMC Health\u2019s net debt equates to 32% of its market capitalization. While that\u2019s enough to warrant consideration, it doesn\u2019t really concern us. The Verdict On NMC Health\u2019s P/E Ratio NMC Health\u2019s P/E is 17.7 which is about average (18.3) in the GB market. Given it has reasonable debt levels, and grew earnings strongly last year, the P/E indicates the market has doubts this growth can be sustained. Because analysts are predicting more growth in the future, one might have expected to see a higher P/E ratio. You can take a closer look at the fundamentals, here . What can be absolutely certain is that the market has become significantly less optimistic about NMC Health over the last month, with the P/E ratio falling from 26.2 back then to 17.7 today. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity. Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If it is underestimating a company, investors can make money by buying and holding the shares until the market corrects itself.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, NMC Health Plc ( LON:NMC ) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating? When Is Debt Dangerous? Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can\u2019t easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company\u2019s debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for NMC Health What Is NMC Health\u2019s Net Debt? You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of June 2019 NMC Health had US$2.10b of debt, an increase on US$2.0k, over one year. On the flip side, it has US$574.1m in cash leading to net debt of about US$1.52b. LSE:NMC Historical Debt, January 17th 2020 How Strong Is NMC Health\u2019s Balance Sheet? The latest balance sheet data shows that NMC Health had liabilities of US$887.7m due within a year, and liabilities of US$2.40b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$574.1m in cash and US$697.3m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$2.02b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables. While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since NMC Health has a market capitalization of US$3.93b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt. We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio). NMC Health\u2019s debt is 2.8 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 2.9 times over. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we\u2019d stop short of calling them problematic. On a lighter note, we note that NMC Health grew its EBIT by 30% in the last year. If sustained, this growth should make that debt evaporate like a scarce drinking water during an unnaturally hot summer. There\u2019s no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NMC Health can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you\u2019re focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts . Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, NMC Health produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 69% of its EBIT, about what we\u2019d expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to. Our View NMC Health\u2019s EBIT growth rate suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14\u2019s goalkeeper. But we must concede we find its interest cover has the opposite effect. It\u2019s also worth noting that NMC Health is in the Healthcare industry, which is often considered to be quite defensive. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that NMC Health can handle its debt fairly comfortably. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on this one. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We\u2019ve spotted 2 warning signs for NMC Health you should be aware of, and 1 of them is a bit concerning. When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don\u2019t even need debt. Readers can access a list of growth stocks with zero net debt 100% free , right now.

Simply Wall St February 17, 2020 In 2017 Prasanth Manghat was appointed CEO of NMC Health Plc ( LON:NMC ). This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at companies of similar size. Next, we\u2019ll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally we will reflect on how common stockholders have fared in the last few years, as a secondary measure of performance. This method should give us information to assess how appropriately the company pays the CEO. See our latest analysis for NMC Health How Does Prasanth Manghat\u2019s Compensation Compare With Similar Sized Companies? At the time of writing, our data says that NMC Health Plc has a market cap of UK\u00a31.6b, and reported total annual CEO compensation of US$5.5m for the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$1.0m. We note that more than half of the total compensation is not the salary; and performance requirements may apply to this non-salary portion. We looked at a group of companies with market capitalizations from US$1.0b to US$3.2b, and the median CEO total compensation was US$1.8m. It would therefore appear that NMC Health Plc pays Prasanth Manghat more than the median CEO remuneration at companies of a similar size, in the same market. However, this fact alone doesn\u2019t mean the remuneration is too high. We can get a better idea of how generous the pay is by looking at the performance of the underlying business. The graphic below shows how CEO compensation at NMC Health has changed from year to year. LSE:NMC CEO Compensation, February 17th 2020 Is NMC Health Plc Growing? NMC Health Plc has increased its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 26% a year, over the last three years (using a line of best fit). It achieved revenue growth of 34% over the last year. This demonstrates that the company has been improving recently. A good result. It\u2019s great to see that revenue growth is strong, too. These metrics suggest the business is growing strongly. You might want to check this free visual report on analyst forecasts for future earnings . Has NMC Health Plc Been A Good Investment? Given the total loss of 56% over three years, many shareholders in NMC Health Plc are probably rather dissatisfied, to say the least. So shareholders would probably think the company shouldn\u2019t be too generous with CEO compensation. In Summary\u2026 We compared the total CEO remuneration paid by NMC Health Plc, and compared it to remuneration at a group of similar sized companies. As discussed above, we discovered that the company pays more than the median of that group. However, the earnings per share growth over three years is certainly impressive. However, the returns to investors are far less impressive, over the same period. One might thus conclude that it would be better if the company waited until growth is reflected in the share price, before increasing CEO compensation. Whatever your view on compensation, you might want to check if insiders are buying or selling NMC Health shares (free trial). Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.
