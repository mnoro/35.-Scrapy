The Johnnie Walker whisky maker took the 1.3 billion pound non-cash writedown related to its businesses in India, Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Windsor whisky brand in South Korea, blaming challenging trading conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On Tuesday, the company reported an 8.4% drop in organic sales for the year ended June 30, larger than the 7.3% fall analysts had expected, company supplied estimates showed. This marks the company's worst annual sales performance in more than a decade, according to Bernstein analysts. Diageo shares were down 6.2% in early trading and was the biggest loser on the FTSE <.FTSE>. The stock is down nearly 10% this year, better than the FTSE's 20% decline over the same period. By region, organic sales in Asia fell the most, dropping 16% due to the impact of coronavirus-related closures of alcohol outlets and bars in India and Thailand, while in China demand was hit by the absence of the Chinese New Year. The company's Latin America, Africa and Europe and Turkey markets also posted double-digit falls in sales, mainly due to disruptions to supply chains and fewer social occasions due to the pandemic. North America was the only bright spot, with sales rising 2%, reflecting strong demand for tequilas and ready-to-drink beverages at supermarkets and alcohol stores, the company said. Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said the strong results in North America, its biggest market by revenue, was because 80% of Diageo's sales came from retail stores, in contrast to other markets, where bars and restaurants make up most of the sales. The company, which also makes Tanqueray Gin, Smirnoff Vodka and a wide range of scotch whiskey, said it was still unable to provide specific outlook for the year, after abandoning a full-year forecast in April. Its 4.5 billion pound capital returns programme remains suspended. \"The hit to earnings should be short lived provided the global economy doesn't take too long to recover,\" William Ryder, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said. \"We think the group will continue to do well long term, but management will have to focus more on debt reduction than they probably would have liked.\" The company also said it would keep paying a dividend, which Liberum analyst Nico Von Stackelberg called a \"positive sign\". After a tough second half of the year \"we should see sequential improvements (in the business) from here,\" he said in a note. Diageo's business outlook was in contrast to French spirits makers Pernod Ricard <PERP.PA> and Remy Cointreau <RCOP.PA> , which last month said the pandemic would not hit their full-year forecasts as strongly as initially feared. Diageo's impairment charge follows those of other alcoholic beverage makers, AB InBev <ABI.BR> and Heineken <HEIN.AS>. While AB Inbev took a $2.5 billion writedown related to its African operations last week, Heineken announced a nearly 550 million euro writedown on Monday.

Natural gas fuel specialist Clean Energy Fuels\u00a0(NASDAQ: CLNE) has been working for years to change that.  It took on a lot of debt to build \"America's Natural Gas Highway,\" lining a coast-to-coast route with natural gas filling stations and placing more in major urban centers to make it easier for trucking companies to switch their fleets to from diesel to natural gas. Bloomberg The World\u2019s Hottest Stock Is a Money-Losing Tech Giant Soaring 880% (Bloomberg) -- It gets far less attention than Tesla, the FAANGs or even the Robinhood flavor of the week.Yet Sea Ltd. has quietly become the world\u2019s best-performing large-cap stock, stoking a debate on Wall Street over whether the Singapore-based gaming, e-commerce and payments company is the next great internet colossus or just Exhibit A in a global tech bubble that\u2019s destined to burst.For now at least, bulls have the upper hand. Swelling optimism that loss-making Sea may one day become both the Tencent and Alibaba of Southeast Asia has boosted its New York-listed shares by more than 880% in the past 18 months, the largest gain worldwide among companies with a starting market value of at least $1 billion. Short sellers who placed record wagers against the stock in June are retreating at an unprecedented pace.If Sea Chief Executive Officer Forrest Li is paying attention to any of this, he\u2019s not letting on. The 42-year-old billionaire said in a video interview that he\u2019s been working seven-day weeks in the office since April, leading his company through what may be its most pivotal year. Demand for Sea\u2019s mobile games and online-shopping platform has surged during the pandemic, and the company is bidding on a Singapore digital-banking license to accelerate its push into financial services. Li is also looking for potential acquisitions in gaming, logistics and e-commerce.\u201cWe don\u2019t like to think too much about our success or how we got here,\u201d he said when asked about Sea\u2019s stock price. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the environment is good or bad. It doesn\u2019t change a company or a person.\u201dEven by the standards of today\u2019s tech boom, Li\u2019s ascent has been remarkable. Born in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, he worked for the local units of Motorola Solutions Inc. and Corning Inc. before enrolling in Stanford\u2019s MBA program. He founded Sea, then known as Garena, in 2009 and took it public with backing from Tencent in 2017.Read more about Li, who named himself after Forrest Gump.After a rocky first year of trading, Sea\u2019s stock has gone on to trounce everything in its class. Initially, the gains were fueled by the runaway success of Sea\u2019s first self-made mobile game -- a battle royale called Free Fire that has attracted as many as 80 million daily active users in more than 130 markets.But Sea\u2019s e-commerce and financial services units are now increasingly important pillars of the bull case. Its Shopee platform overtook Alibaba\u2019s Lazada in the fourth quarter of 2019 to become the top e-commerce provider in Southeast Asia, according to research firm iPrice, and the business accounted for more than 40% of Sea\u2019s revenue in 2019, up from 2.3% in 2017.SeaMoney, which offers everything from e-wallets to micro loans, could ultimately be just as large, according to Li. \u201cWe think this is a huge business opportunity,\u201d he said.Read more: Sea\u2019s Singapore Digital Bank Bid Targets Millennials, SMEsThe soft-spoken founder has some big-name believers. Tencent still owns about 20% of Sea, and the stock was the biggest holding as of May in Noah Blackstein\u2019s Dynamic Power Global Growth Class fund, one of the world\u2019s top-performing equity mutual funds of the past decade. Other prominent shareholders include Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global Management LLC and Kora Management LP, an emerging markets-focused hedge fund in New York, according to regulatory filings as of March.Kora began investing in Sea in early 2018 after meeting with Li, Daniel Jacobs, the hedge fund\u2019s founding partner, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last two years a company that\u2019s got a great team and great products going after a big market and just executing incredibly well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is a mini Tencent and has the ability to be a really successful, large company in a global context.\u201dSea has already claimed the title of biggest company in Southeast Asia after its market value swelled to $65 billion, topping DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and PT Bank Central Asia for the first time earlier this year. Revenue has also grown quickly, jumping 163% to $2.2 billion in 2019, though it\u2019s still just a fraction of DBS\u2019s $11 billion.As for Sea\u2019s $1.46 billion net loss last year? Jacobs isn\u2019t bothered by it. \u201cThey are thoughtful and prudent about building a business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very much of the view that the company has all this under control.\u201dNot everyone is convinced.DBS Bank Ltd. analyst Sachin Mittal downgraded his recommendation on Sea to sell in July, citing Indonesia\u2019s new tax regulations for cross-border transactions and the likelihood of the company burning through cash to grow its payments business. \u201cThere is a tech bubble right now,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSea\u2019s stock is overvalued and it\u2019s partly a reflection of the industry.\u201dWhile short sellers have closed out bets against Sea at a rapid clip in recent weeks, they still have a bearish position worth more than $3 billion, or about 8% of the stock\u2019s free float, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. \u201cMark-to-market losses may have forced shorts out of their position,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. \u201cBut they may still have a negative outlook.\u201dSkeptics note that Sea faces deep-pocketed competitors in all of its main businesses, from Lazada to Grab Holdings Inc. and a slew of other up-and-comers in digital finance. Meanwhile, Sea\u2019s gaming unit has yet to prove it\u2019s more than just a one-hit wonder.Read more: Alibaba Helps Asia\u2019s Malls Go Online After Virus Upends Retail\u201cWe could have a post-Covid situation where the jack-up in revenue does not materialize, and the gaming business is doing well but rests on only one popular game,\u201d said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer equity research at Tellimer Ltd.Sea optimists see little reason to cash in. In fact, Georg Krijgh, founder and head of the investment team at Amsterdam-based Fratres, said his firm\u2019s Knight Tech Fund, which has 150 million euros ($177 million) under management, plans to add to its Sea holdings.The stock is already the fund\u2019s second-largest position after Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company that has gained more than 500% in the past 18 months. \u201cThere are always people who like to short excellent companies such as Sea, Tesla or Carvana, mainly based on the argument of a high valuation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inferior strategy.\u201dSea\u2019s biggest challenge now may have less to do with execution than with meeting investors\u2019 \u201csky-high\u201d expectations, said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In the past seven days alone, Sea\u2019s stock has soared 28% to record.For his part, Li appears well aware that the bar has increased. It\u2019s been hard not to notice with everyone calling his company a Southeast Asian mashup of Tencent and Alibaba, two of the most successful businesses in history.\u201cWe learned a lot from those pioneers,\u201d said Li, who has an estimated net worth of $7.5 billion. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we don\u2019t need to be their mini versions. We can just be ourselves.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Collectively, the seven SPA's will provide annual recurring fixed fees of approximately $1.4 billion over a multi-year period providing a strong underpinning for the project's investment grade credit profile.

Bloomberg China Oil Giants Get Premiums in $56 Billion Pipeline Accord (Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s biggest oil and gas companies finalized deals worth $56 billion to sell their pipeline networks to a new national carrier at premiums to their book value, a long-awaited step that\u2019s being seen as a boost for investors.PetroChina Co. will get 1.2 times book value for assets including pipelines, storage and import terminals while Sinopec will get 1.4 times in the deals. The premium valuations are likely to put to rest investor concerns over whether the state-mandated deal would compensate the companies properly for their extensive networks and reward shareholders.The agreements also create a 500 billion yuan ($71 billion) national carrier known as the China Oil & Gas Pipeline Network Corp. that will be at the center of reform efforts by President Xi Jinping\u2019s government to boost domestic energy production and distribution in the world\u2019s top consumer.\u201cWe see these announcements as positive for the companies as the valuations are market friendly,\u201d Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts including Neil Beveridge said in a note, adding that both companies are likely to issue special dividends. PipeChina\u2019s capitalization \u201cwould make it one of the largest pipeline companies in the world should it come to market,\u201d they wrote.As part of the deals announced Tuesday, PetroChina will receive consideration totaling 268.7 billion yuan, which includes a 29.9% stake in PipeChina and 119 billion in cash, according to the filings and an analysis by Morgan Stanley, which upgraded its rating on the stock.Sinopec, known officially as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., will receive a total of 122.7 billion yuan, which breaks down into a 14% stake in PipeChina and 52.7 billion in cash, according to its filing.No announcement has been made yet regarding asset transfers from China National Offshore Oil Corp., the nation\u2019s biggest liquefied natural gas importer, or Kunlun Energy Co., a PetroChina subsidiary that owns a gas pipeline and several LNG terminals.PetroChina closed 2.1% higher on Friday in Hong Kong, while Sinopec was unchanged, both paring earlier gains. Kunlun added 5.3%.As of 2015, China had 64,000 kilometers (about 40,000 miles) of pipelines carrying natural gas, 27,000 carrying crude and 21,000 carrying oil products, according to China\u2019s main economic planning agency. Most of those are owned by PetroChina and its parent, China National Petroleum Corp.PetroChina\u2019s dominance of the distribution network was seen as stunting the domestic drilling industry, as other firms could be blocked or have to pay prohibitively expensive fees to get their oil and gas to market. PipeChina, on the other hand, is expected to offer open access to the networks.(Updates with details in seventh paragraph and share prices in eighth.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. Reuters PipeChina to take on $56 billion of pipelines to boost network access China took a major step in the reform of its national oil and gas pipeline network, with newly formed PipeChina agreeing to buy pipelines and storage facilities valued at 391.4 billion yuan ($55.9 billion).  Under the deal, PipeChina, known formally as China Oil and Gas Pipeline Network, will take over oil and gas pipelines and storage facilities from state-owned energy giants PetroChina and Sinopec, in return for cash and equity in the pipeline company.

Top Reactions D D Follow the flow of gold:  For a majority of the Covid - 19 pandemic I have watched the price premium between London and the COMEX closely.  HIstorically the prices of the two markets are within a dollar because of the arbitrage trade that happens when a spread develops.  During the first few months of Covid -19, COMEX prices diverged and the spread opened to as much as $40.00.  This was unprecedented and gold flowed by the ton for delivery at the COMEX. The COMEX even started a special contract for 400 ounce delivery bars because the shortage was so acute and COMEX contracts are for 100 ounce bars.  July's contract holders stood for a record 90 tons of gold for delivery, the arbitrage traders leased airplanes and flew the gold from London to the U.S.  The spread closed dramatically and (as normally happens) reached par a few days after settlement. Then the August delivery came due last Friday and an unbelievable 100 +++ tons stood for delivery.  The spread exploded to $20.00 again and did not close as expected upon delivery of the gold.  The spread stands at $16.03 as I write and this is unheard of after settlement. What is going on?  This is what I see...  First notices were placed for intended delivery on 463,000 tons of gold over the next three months on the COMEX. We should see extreme volatility in the gold market over the next three months. Sharp upward spikes by short traders being caught by margin limits followed by large runs on the stops placed by traders trying to protect their gains... Buckle up kiddies, this is going to be fun, and, I think profitable! As this missive started, follow the spreads and flow of gold! More Bullish Reply Replies (9) 13 1 D D Will a short squeeze be triggered by recent price action?  YES!   We have to look at the Commitment Of Traders (COT) report to glean any insight. What we see is a total of 105,025 contracts short.  We also see a large number of trading houses looking to get into the gold market because they do not want to get \"left out\" of the incredible rally that is going on.  So short story is - - - Yes, there is ample fuel to trigger a short squeeze on gold.  It is considerably more likely in the silver market... All of this is good for Yamana! Enjoy!

Reply Replies (7) 6 2 D D Real interest rates pushing savers, pension funds, bond funds and money managers into gold.  For decades, people have repeated the mantra that gold has no yield.  Even while it appreciated quietly while sitting in home safes or vaults.  Now almost all of Europe, and many asian countries have negative bond yields and holding cash costs money.  Ireland just declared a .65% charge for holding the cash deposits on over 100 billion euros held by pension funds.  These pension funds have defined benefits and must invest in appreciating assets in order to stay solvent.  Cash is not only being diluted, it costs money to hold!  This is a similar situation to the U.S. municipal retirement funds which can only stay solvent if they earn returns above 6% annually.  Bonds and treasuries are now yielding almost nothing and the funds are being forced into other stable but income producing assets. Yamana fits the bill given its small dividend but excellent appreciation potential given its leverage to the price of gold. BTW, nearly 150 tons of gold stood for delivery on Friday in the usually quiet August futures settlement.  There was a shortage of deliverable gold and price scramble leading to the continuous contract closing at $1,994! Indications are that there are another 460 tons standing for delivery in the next three months.  Outstanding news for mining companies. More Reply 13 B Bernie the fact the gold is up today and some miners are down is proof that everyone is still largely clueless to the bull run Reply Replies (8) 4 1 F FDM Trying to put a reason behind the sluggishness of the price movement for AUY after such a great qtr and forward forecast and gold sitting around the $2,000/ounce level.. Couple of quick thoughts beyond what has already been discussed: Could it be analysts are not satisfied with the slowness of moving to production Agua Rica, Canadian Malartic expansion, etc in the near future.  Projecting 900k ounces this year 1.0m to 1.1m over 2021 and 2022 is not a great thing when you have monster upside with undeveloped/underdeveloped properties and are slow to bring them online and could contribute another 400k ounces a year. Miners are not you typical manufacturing company as their inventory is finite.  You need to produce when the price is up, develop properties when the price is stable.  No one knows when the increase in gold price may go down again.  If you are unable to ramp up to significant volume quickly, then you may miss a huge opportunity.  @D, I appreciate the numbers you are publishing and I agree that it will only get better over the next few months as the price of gold rises but I think we have lost a huge opportunity for big wins in AUY due to the sluggishness of bringing online proven reserves. I believe this is a result of earlier mismanagement of assets prior to Racine changing the guidance and strategy of AUY.  Unfortunately, he has been handcuffed by numerous prior missteps and is now trying to catch up.  By increasing the dividends and reward stockholders is nice, having 1 Billion in share outstanding doesn't help the problem. I do believe that as AUY is so cheap it could be a merger candidate as a result of huge proven undeveloped reserves.  A much larger player may be able to develop these properties faster. but is it worth $7 to $8 billion to get them. @NYSE, I am fully behind your comments as I also see this popping to the $9 to $12 range.  But a far cry from what should have been. There are many others (@Steve, etc), who I appreciate their input.  But I must admit I miss @rj!!! I would appreciate other thoughts anyone has to offer.

So far, there have been 20 trading days in July.  I have taken the published price of the Gold Continuous Contract each day and totaled the 20 trading days since July 1st, then divided that total by 20 for an average probable realized price of $1,840. This represents an improvement of $127 over Q2's realized price for gold. I will update this periodically as the quarter progresses so we can make a reasonable projection of Yamana's revenue.

Bloomberg Biggest U.S. Banks Have More Than $150 Billion of Deferred Loans (Bloomberg) -- The four largest U.S. banks had at least $151.5 billion of loans with payments in deferral at midyear as borrowers from small businesses to homeowners sought debt relief amid the coronavirus pandemic.Programs vary among banks and account types, with Bank of America Corp. offering deferrals of as long as 60 days on consumer credit cards, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. giving clients rolling, three-month deferrals for as much as a year on residential mortgages. The two lenders, along with Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co., disclosed deferral details in their second-quarter filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Uncertainty over the length of the pandemic and resulting economic crisis have made it difficult for banks to determine how many loans are likely to sour. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo set aside more than $32 billion for loan losses in the second quarter, close to a record, signaling that relief programs may not be enough to stave off a flood of bad debt.The rapid rollout of forbearance programs in March averted financial ruin for millions of households, giving Congress time to bolster unemployment benefits and offer emergency aid to businesses. The goal was to avoid a tidal wave of defaults by borrowers who began losing income when states locked down commerce to slow infections.The four biggest U.S. banks differ on how they report payment deferrals and loan modifications, and the total balance of financing with deferred payments is likely higher than $151.5 billion. While Wells Fargo, for example, reported $44.2 billion of consumer loans in deferral as of midyear, it said only that it modified $38.2 billion of commercial loans without disclosing the amount remaining in deferral by June 30.Deferrals on residential mortgages and home-equity loans were a common theme across all four banks. The majority of Wells Fargo\u2019s consumer deferrals were on a combined $35 billion of first and second mortgages, representing 12% and 10% of each loan type, respectively. Almost 9% of JPMorgan\u2019s residential real estate portfolio was subject to payment deferrals, representing nearly three-quarters of the total $28.3 billion of consumer loans in deferral.At Citigroup, consumer credit cards represented the largest portion of modified loans, with $6.9 billion of debt enrolled in deferral programs, or 5% of its North American credit-card business. The bank modified about $20 billion of consumer loans globally as of June 30.Bank of America, which provided figures as of July 23, was deferring payments on $7.7 billion in commercial loans and $28.5 billion in consumer and small-business debt. About 7% of consumer-card balances received modifications, as did 20% of small-business card balances.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg Rocket to Cut IPO to About $2 Billion from $3.3 Billion (Bloomberg) -- Rocket Companies Inc., the parent of the mortgage giant founded by billionaire Dan Gilbert, is now seeking to raise about $2 billion in an initial public offering after initially targeting as much as $3.3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.The Detroit-based company -- which expects to price its IPO Wednesday -- is set to market a reduced number of shares at about $18 to $20 apiece, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn\u2019t public. The reduction comes as investors pushed back on the company\u2019s valuation, believing it should be priced as a consumer or financial company rather than a technology business, one of the people said.Rocket, which operates Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage, had earlier filed to sell 150 million shares at $20 to $22 each. Terms aren\u2019t finalized and could still change, the people said.A representative for Rocket didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The downsizing may signal the IPO market\u2019s rebound is straining as the coronavirus pandemic deepens across much of the U.S. Since mid-March, only one major listing -- supermarket chain Albertsons Cos. -- has priced below a marketed range, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Companies have raised about $61 billion through first-time share sales on U.S. exchanges this year, compared with $50 billion for the same period in 2019, the data shows. That includes a record amount for so-called blank-check companies -- $24 billion, almost double the volume for all of 2019.Dan GilbertRocket describes itself as the largest retail mortgage lender in the U.S. Gilbert, who founded Quicken Loans in 1985, will retain 79% of the voting power of the company\u2019s common stock through controlling entities, the filings show.Gilbert, who was chief executive officer of Quicken Loans until 2002, is also the owner of the National Basketball Association\u2018s Cleveland Cavaliers. He has a net worth of $8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Rocket\u2019s offering is being led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Royal Bank of Canada. The shares are expected to begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RKT.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. \u00a9 2020 Verizon Media.

I really do think that the virus hit just when this product was about to be adopted by many doctors and patients.  I mean there are no other Peanut Allergy drugs on the market like this so I would think this will be a huge plus for those having to deal with this allergy.  In an year or two from now I wouldn't  be surprised to see this stock trading in the mid 30's which is probably very conservative. At the current price of $16 this could be and in my opinion a great price to begin accumulating shares. Barring some major issue with the peanut drug this stock could go a lot higher down the road.

INO-4800 is the safest vaccine by a landslide, and therefore is the only vaccine that could even be considered for emergency use. It would make absolute sense to push INO out as quickly as possible due to its impeccable safety profile (across the entire platform as well) and try it first. If the vaccine is ineffective--which we know it will be stellar--then let people attempt the more dangerous options if they choose to. I think the fact that these vaccines will be \"use at your own risk\" also gives INO a monstrous advantage More Reply 64 3 R Richard For those of you who purchased INO due to its potential Covid vaccine, you need to understand how this company operates. Long-term investors understand that Inovio plays by the book and believes that proper protocols will always be followed despite an urgency to bring a product to the marketplace. The company gets in trouble when it attempts to move away from its standard operating procedures. Inovio management has always believed that the science dictates success. Since Covid was first discovered in January, Inovio has not embellished the truth nor made promises it could not keep. It knows that rushing a vaccine that doesn't work or is not safe does will be a failure in the long run. Kim and Broderick have acknowledged that vaccines typically take a minimum of 3 years to develop and that the Covid vaccine timeline has been accelerated significantly.  It is frustrating that the peer review has not been released yet but this could turn out quite favorably since NVAX results just came out. Just think if the peer review was made available right before NVAX P1 results. INO would have been overshadowed and potential gains may have been muted significantly. Recency bias is comes into play with Covid stocks--the most recent announcements gets the attention of investors. If you are looking for NVAX or VXRT type gains with INO within the next few months (or days/weeks for short-term traders), it's not going to happen. Also, you cannot look at the absolute stock price and say that NVAX is 7-8x the value of INO. Market cap is a better measure (NVAX market cap about 3x that of INO).  Sure, Inovio management would like to see higher stock prices for its shareholders but it's not going to make that it's priority. Instead, they will let the science and clinical results lead the way and, if successful, shareholders will be rewarded. Unfortunately for the impatient ones, it won't come soon enough. Remember that money flows from the impatient to the patient. INO is not a short-term play on the long side. You are better off investing in smaller market cap Covid stocks to achieve quick returns.

INO is not, INO is confident in its rigorous scientific process. INO aims to provide durable vaccine, they took time to watch the results for up to 13 weeks because they are confident. They covered elder population in trials because they are confident. The designed it to protect from at least two strains of COVID-19, including the newer extremely infectious strain. Reply 32 1 T Texas (Updated - June 26, 2020 9:01 AM EDT) (updated to add analyst comments) Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Charles Duncan raised its price target on Inovio Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: INO) to $45.00 (from $17.00) while maintaining an Overweight rating. The analyst commented, \". We reiterate our Overweight rating and are raising our PT to $45 from $17 per share on INO. We recently hosted Inovio for investor meetings. As a result of our due diligence, from which we gleaned incremental updates on ongoing clinical programs for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate INO-4800 and its most clinically advanced therapeutic, VGX-3100 for cervical dysplasia, we have enhanced conviction about the broad potential of Inovio\u2019s platform. More Reply 10 1 L Lee64 Thanks to many of the members of the Board for their insights and perspectives.    They have been very informative and helpful. I think we all agree that INO is seeking to become a leader in the application of DNA medicines or vaccines.  And, although it has a nice pipeline of products under evaluation, its stock price has risen in bulk due to its efforts on INO-4800. Focusing on INO-4800 there has been funding from various sources such as CEPI \u2013 etc yet the major piece of this was from DOD at $71 million for the Cellectra device (not the plasmid itself). Meantime there has been talk about OWS, politics, conflicts of interest, massive funding of other companies and sky high SPs as a result of it.  Furthermore, there is little mention of INO from the WH or OWS \u2013 and as we all frustratingly know \u2013 little PR or information released about INO-4800 and no additional funding as of yet. From what we do know \u2013  the human P1 results should be very good, the attributes of INO-4800 may be more attractive than other candidate vaccines ie storage, safety, longer term resilience and overall efficacy. And many of us are waiting for the P1 data to be released as part of the peer review as well as some type of funding from one of many sources.  People are attributing the lack of communication to INO\u2019s Board, Dr. Kim, the people running OWS, etc which in turn is not driving the valuation of the company. We also know that Inovio\u2019s strategy is to let the data do the talking. As quick background the initial CEPI and DOD funding drove the stock price \u2013 and its been again quiet since then. Speaking of the DOD \u2013 in this article below, the rate of infection within the military is rising in July twice the rate of growth of the general population. https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/07/10/militarys-covid-19-cases-growing-at-twice-the-nationwide-rate/ If one considers a major objective of containing COVID-19 and getting it under control in the military, would that not be considered a matter of national security?  Does one not think there is daily communication between the FDA, the DOD, OWS and others regarding INO-4800 capabilities.  If INO-4800 is the \u2018best\u2019 vaccine (safe and effective) \u2013 and if we consider our troops and military as critical \u2013 what steps would you be taking and what kind of PR if any would you conduct? If this scenario appears reasonable could it not explain the information drought that we are experiencing?  And if you are INO Mgmt \u2013 how do you strike the balance of communicating with all stakeholders as a public company while potentially honoring the wishes of DOD and the President who perhaps wish to quietly immunize military.  I would say its rather challenging. Yes INO-4800 is being used in P1 tests in SK, China and a few other countries yet all those initiatives were agreed to earlier in the year before this turned into a pandemic. And again, INO provided only the plasmid and the cellectra device \u2013 not the means or methods to reconstruct the DNA strand.  So no IP was shared by INO. INO is indeed following normal clinical trial protocols and not releasing data before the publication reviewing the data makes it available- yet perhaps for very good reasons \u2013 which unfortunately at this time is affecting shareholders. So \u2013 its just another thought to consider.  If the INO-4800 P1 data and peer review lives up to expectations \u2013 eventually the funding will follow.  In the meantime \u2013 perhaps the company is quietly supporting our military needs. More Cases in the military surged 33% in the past 10 days, twice the rate of new cases nationwide.

I bought halfway, I was shocked... +7%, for a short moment it was higher than NVAX... I understood a thing: endorsing and approving a vaccine in a fast-track that deliver medium to severe side effects is a big deal... as long as the efficacy is not high it's not a big problem (tbh, the 50% bar is very low)... side effects in this race are super important: 1. most people are asymptomatic, if side effects can be severe, many people won't take it. 2. heavy side effects will strengthen no-vax movement lowering down current and future vaccine acceptance 3. having severe side effects in the population will be an opportunity to blame on the fast-track approach, the FDA, the government, etc... nobody cares if the antibody response is 94% or 101%...  in a fast-track approach side effects are a very big deal... we'll know which one is the safest...

Reply 7 B Bobby Hi everyone, I apologize in advance for the length of this somber message but I think today was the proverbial \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d moment for me.  Let me start off by saying I am not a true long.  I started investing in INO starting in March; however, although it was the Covid play that brought my attention to INO, it was their near-term catalysts for cervical dysplasia and glioblastoma that truly intrigued me. I researched their DNA vaccine as well as their delivery device and came to the conclusion that it was worth my investment.  I won\u2019t profess my background because, for one, I can\u2019t prove it on the internet, and two, it really doesn\u2019t matter.  I expected like most biotech plays, that the share price would raise and fall based on the success of the product; however, this has not been the case as you all are painfully aware.  We were the second vaccine to start phase 1 trials behind Moderna and we have dramatically fallen behind other vaccine companies that started after us.  Time-and -gain, we wake up to other companies being highlighted in the media and their share prices soaring while we remain stagnant or decline.  My frustration initially centered on Dr. Fauci- trying to find an external reason for our lack of advancement.  My frustration then led to Dr. Kim - surly it was his fault that the company was not soaring.  However, I have finally settled on the fact that board of directors are ultimately responsible.  Dr. Kim is the CEO, but he is still an employee that must answer to the board of directors.  It is the Board\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the right person is the CEO - one that can move the company forward.  Clearly the Board has failed and we, the shareholders, have suffered.  When comparing investing in technology vs. biotech one thing becomes clear - in biotech there is too much emphasis on the product.  When investing in the manufacturer of AMD chips or Intel chips you do care about the product, but you care more how each company is going to obtain market share while keeping competition at bay.  In other word, the CEO is not necessarily the scientist, but rather a businessman.  I do not see a well-thoughtout plan for INO.  Dr. Kim refers to COVID as a marathon and that is where the problem lies.  Covid is a sprint and failure to see that is the cause of our share price depression.  This administration, and the world for that matter, want a vaccine as fast as possible.  This is a rare circumstance where a good product today is preferable to an outstanding product later.  I believe management and the Board failed to see this and this was compounded by the \u201cpeer review\u201d self-imposed requirement.  This was a marketing strategy that was ill-founded in retrospect.  Dr. Kim proposed this after Moderna shared interim results, hoping to capitalize on a perceived misstep by Moderna.  However, the misstep was Dr. Kim\u2019s.  By self-imposing this \u201cpeer review\u201d requirement we turned our sprint into a marathon when the greatest asset that we had was speed.  Now, our fate is in the hands of the reviewers and we are left hoping that we get the results soon as other companies pass us by.  Unfortunately, the usual way companies generate money is by issuing stocks at the expense of shareholders.  This was a highly unusual circumstance where large amounts of money was being provided without shareholder dilution for companies to bring a product to market.  If we miss out on this funding, i fear the only way forward is for the company to raise funds through shares at our expense. It has been particularly difficult as a shareholder because 1) I feel we let our major advantage of speed slip away resulting in a depressed share price and loss of investment/profits and 2)  Because we are afraid  that the moment we leave the stock, the stock price will shoot up, we stay and lose out on other opportunities. I hope we get some positive news this week and that all shareholders become rewarded for their passion and resilience, but I think the peer review is weeks out and that the conference call after the earnings report is just to tell us that good news will be coming and stay the course.  Hope that I am wrong.  Best of luck to all More Neutral Reply Replies (92) 153 81 R Ron Putting the VGXI news together...

Anyway, it is all starting to make sense now...INO\u2019s goal was an EUA all along and that\u2019s not going to be granted based on a pre print, also a court is not going to compel GeneOne to transfer there elution tech to 3ps without an EUA. What I think happens is the second peer review is complete, the EUA is granted contingent on VGXI elution tech and that is enough for a judge to order GeneOne and VGXI to transfer the elution tech to Ology and others as well as grant RH permission to use being that they already have it.

Top Reactions D D Follow the flow of gold:  For a majority of the Covid - 19 pandemic I have watched the price premium between London and the COMEX closely.  HIstorically the prices of the two markets are within a dollar because of the arbitrage trade that happens when a spread develops.  During the first few months of Covid -19, COMEX prices diverged and the spread opened to as much as $40.00.  This was unprecedented and gold flowed by the ton for delivery at the COMEX. The COMEX even started a special contract for 400 ounce delivery bars because the shortage was so acute and COMEX contracts are for 100 ounce bars.  July's contract holders stood for a record 90 tons of gold for delivery, the arbitrage traders leased airplanes and flew the gold from London to the U.S.  The spread closed dramatically and (as normally happens) reached par a few days after settlement. Then the August delivery came due last Friday and an unbelievable 100 +++ tons stood for delivery.  The spread exploded to $20.00 again and did not close as expected upon delivery of the gold.  The spread stands at $16.03 as I write and this is unheard of after settlement. What is going on?  This is what I see...  First notices were placed for intended delivery on 463,000 tons of gold over the next three months on the COMEX. We should see extreme volatility in the gold market over the next three months. Sharp upward spikes by short traders being caught by margin limits followed by large runs on the stops placed by traders trying to protect their gains...

These pension funds have defined benefits and must invest in appreciating assets in order to stay solvent.  Cash is not only being diluted, it costs money to hold!  This is a similar situation to the U.S. municipal retirement funds which can only stay solvent if they earn returns above 6% annually.  Bonds and treasuries are now yielding almost nothing and the funds are being forced into other stable but income producing assets. Yamana fits the bill given its small dividend but excellent appreciation potential given its leverage to the price of gold. BTW, nearly 150 tons of gold stood for delivery on Friday in the usually quiet August futures settlement.  There was a shortage of deliverable gold and price scramble leading to the continuous contract closing at $1,994! Indications are that there are another 460 tons standing for delivery in the next three months.  Outstanding news for mining companies. More Reply 13 B Bernie the fact the gold is up today and some miners are down is proof that everyone is still largely clueless to the bull run Reply Replies (8) 4 1 F FDM Trying to put a reason behind the sluggishness of the price movement for AUY after such a great qtr and forward forecast and gold sitting around the $2,000/ounce level.. Couple of quick thoughts beyond what has already been discussed: Could it be analysts are not satisfied with the slowness of moving to production Agua Rica, Canadian Malartic expansion, etc in the near future.  Projecting 900k ounces this year 1.0m to 1.1m over 2021 and 2022 is not a great thing when you have monster upside with undeveloped/underdeveloped properties and are slow to bring them online and could contribute another 400k ounces a year. Miners are not you typical manufacturing company as their inventory is finite.  You need to produce when the price is up, develop properties when the price is stable.  No one knows when the increase in gold price may go down again.  If you are unable to ramp up to significant volume quickly, then you may miss a huge opportunity.  @D, I appreciate the numbers you are publishing and I agree that it will only get better over the next few months as the price of gold rises but I think we have lost a huge opportunity for big wins in AUY due to the sluggishness of bringing online proven reserves. I believe this is a result of earlier mismanagement of assets prior to Racine changing the guidance and strategy of AUY.  Unfortunately, he has been handcuffed by numerous prior missteps and is now trying to catch up.  By increasing the dividends and reward stockholders is nice, having 1 Billion in share outstanding doesn't help the problem. I do believe that as AUY is so cheap it could be a merger candidate as a result of huge proven undeveloped reserves.  A much larger player may be able to develop these properties faster. but is it worth $7 to $8 billion to get them. @NYSE, I am fully behind your comments as I also see this popping to the $9 to $12 range.  But a far cry from what should have been. There are many others (@Steve, etc), who I appreciate their input.  But I must admit I miss @rj!!! I would appreciate other thoughts anyone has to offer.

So far, there have been 20 trading days in July.  I have taken the published price of the Gold Continuous Contract each day and totaled the 20 trading days since July 1st, then divided that total by 20 for an average probable realized price of $1,840.

I told you that for the common man gold and silver which are created in FINITE. Amounts and havd no COUNTER PARTY risk would be the best way for the common man to protect what little wealth they have from the destruction and mismangement of the us dollar. In addition the us has completely mismanaged the virus and china and many other countries are recovering while we flounder, too lazy and spoiled to do the right things, and our so called freedoms have worked against us. In addition the US economy is based on massive ENTERTAINMENT like sports, concerts, restaurants, casinos, cruises, services like gyms and hair salons, yoga studios, resorts, bars, taverns, bowling alleys, tatoo parlors etc and this virus is the worst thing for the us economy.... Gold had already risen to all time highs in every currency except the us dollar and now due to the actions of the fed and treasury, gold today has breached the highest level it has ever been as smart large investors acquire as much as they can to protect their wealth from a falling dollar. Steven Roach says the dollar will fall at least 35% from here and gold and silver will certainly rise that much and more and peter shiff who so many bash but who called the housing financial crisis, has correctly predicted what is occurring today.. Many think gold and silver will pull back big, i disagree because gold and silver are veey tiny and underowned with only about 1% of investors have any and can rise much more than people think. In addition many banks and hedge funds have made billions shorting gold and silver for 9 years and are caught today on the wrong side of the trade. Many hedge funds and even some banks likely to be bankrupted by what is occurung in the silver and gild markets today and in the next few months.. If bitcoin can rise 20 or 30 times gold can certainly rise 3 or 4 times or up to 4000 and silver 80 to 100 dollats per oz.. this bull market is just getting starting with trillions exiting the stock, bond, and real estate markets and buying gold and silver to diversify and protect their portfolios.. Silver and gold eagles are best imo because they are us currency and easily recognized but all bulion have hefty premiums as the so called spot price is set much lower than what owners will sell the real thing for, however these coins are still excdllent buys today. Do not but etfs gld slv as these are not audited and may prove fraudulent in the future, for trading retirement accounts i recommend  PHYS PSLV CEF sprott funds audited monthly, held at the royal canadian mint and will deliver physical to you on demand if you have enough shares see their data sheet. In any event these are sad days imo for Americans who will pay a very hefty price for the 12 years of fed induced credit debt funancial asset explosion and todays treasury actions. The US today is like The end of Rome where they destroyed their currency needlesly to benefit the wealthy... GLTU you will need it... PS: see my post earlier on GLD board that i posted over 6 months ago initially where i predicted exactly what is occurring today.. my brother calling for pullback today, i doubt it there are many more investors getting into this space and there is no fever like Gold fever once it get started... many hedge funds, individual investors who made money for years shorting gold and silver are today on the WRONG SIDE of the trade and will learn the lessons of their lives and cause short squeezes as they are forced to buy to close their short posititions.. $SLV $HL $GOLD $GLD $GDX $AEM $AMD $GDXJ $SIL $PAAS $CDE More Reply Replies (13) 31 26 M MrPocket Gold hit $2020 in 2020!!!

Bullion\u2019s surge came as a gauge of the U.S. currency sank to the lowest in more than a year, the latest in a long line of bullish factors -- including negative real rates in the U.S. and bets the Federal Reserve will keep policy accommodative when it meets this week -- that are pushing prices ever higher. With the world facing an extended period of unprecedented economic and political turmoil, gold\u2019s now got $2,000 in its sights. Some in the market suggest the haven could rise even beyond that. Nascent signs of gold\u2019s record-breaking ascent began to show in mid-2019, when the Fed signaled a readiness to cut interest rates as uncertainty -- primarily about the impact of the U.S.\u2019s trade battles -- clouded its outlook. The rally gathered pace in early 2020 as geopolitical tensions rose and the coronavirus outbreak hurt growth worldwide, pushing governments and central banks to unleash vast amounts of stimulus, and sending real rates slumping further into negative territory. \u201cStrong gains are inevitable as we enter a period much like the post-GFC environment, where gold prices soared to record levels as a result of copious amounts of Fed money being pumped into the financial system,\u201d said Gavin Wendt, senior resource analyst at MineLife Pty. A weak dollar and negative real rates are providing further impetus. Gold may consolidate before setting its sights on $2,000 and above in coming weeks, he said. The Message Behind Gold\u2019s Rally: The World Economy Is in Trouble Investment demand has been unrelenting. Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded funds have beaten all-time highs nearly every month since late last year and inflows this year have topped the record annual total set in 2009. The additions make up roughly one-fifth of expected mine supply for the year, according to research group Metals Focus. Gold\u2019s been drawing investors even as equities climbed -- with the exception of a sharp selloff in March as traders liquidated bullion holdings to cover losses in other markets -- and it\u2019s U.S. bonds that have been the key metric to watch. The metal is serving as an attractive hedge as yields on Treasuries that strip out the effects of inflation fall below zero. Read More: Mighty Short Squeeze May Be Building in Gold: John Authers The environment has even raised the specter of stagflation, a rare combination of sluggish growth and rising inflation that erodes the value of fixed-income investments. In the U.S., investor expectations for annual inflation over the next decade, as measured by a bond-market metric known as breakevens, have moved higher the past four months after plunging in March. Inflation also plays an important role in looking at prices in an historical context. Spot gold traded as high as $1,945.72 on Monday before closing at $1,942.24, topping its previous record by more than $20. Gold futures for December delivery settled at $1,955.40, a record for a most-active contract. Spot silver jumped as much as 8.1% to $24.6031 an ounce, the highest since 2013. When adjusted for inflation, bullion remains lower than its 2011 high and far below the historic peak in 1980, in the wake of the second oil price shock. It\u2019s not just price moves that are proving historic. The virus shined a spotlight on a traditionally overlooked corner of the market: logistics. A chaotic period in March saw extreme distortions between London and New York gold prices due to an unprecedented snarl in the movement of physical metal, with the grounding of flights and refinery shutdowns sparking concerns about a shortage of bullion available in New York in time to deliver against Comex futures. That crisis eased -- there was enough gold -- but the dislocation prompted CME Group Inc., which owns Comex, to announce that it would offer a new futures contract with expanded delivery options that included 400-ounce bars, which is the size accepted in London. It later said traders will be able to deliver gold in London vaults against the new contract. Fed Meets Next up for investors and a possible fillip for gold, is this week\u2019s Fed meeting July 28-29, where officials are expected to keep interest rates near zero and debate a possible shift in its strategy. Story continues The Fed\u2019s path forward will be closely watched. From December 2008 to June 2011, the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of debt and held borrowing costs near zero percent in a bid to shore up growth, helping send bullion to a record in September 2011. On top of historic low rates, central banks and governments have passed trillions in stimulus packages to curb the economic toll of the pandemic, and if that continues, investors will continue to buy into gold, said Nitesh Shah, London-based director of research at WisdomTree. \u201cSome investors out there are a little uneasy or uncertain about what this means for the long-term future,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these stimulus packages can\u2019t be withdrawn at some point in time when the economy can handle it, are these things going to become quite inflationary?\u201d Read More: Fed to Debate Dimming Outlook as Virus Surges, Fiscal Help Hangs Forecasts for further gains have been building even before gold\u2019s most recent breakthrough. Bank of America Corp. has stuck with its April forecast for $3,000 gold over the next 18 months. UBS Group AG sees prices reaching $2,000 by end-September, global chief investment officer Mark Haefele said in a note Monday.

At least eight of China's dozens of airlines have introduced similar deals since June, often priced around $500 for in some cases unlimited flights.  The global aviation industry is keenly eyeing China as a pilot for air travel recovery trends, as the country reopened its economy months earlier than other places after managing to bring the pandemic mostly under control - at least for now. Reuters U.S. will allow Chinese passenger carriers to fly two flights per week The U.S. Transportation Department said Friday it will allow Chinese passenger air carriers to operate two flights after Beijing said it would ease coronavirus restrictions to allow in more foreign carriers.  On Wednesday, Washington said it planned to bar all Chinese passenger airlines from flying to the United States by June 16 due to Beijing's curbs on U.S. carriers.  The revised order Friday cuts in half the four weekly round trip flights Chinese passenger carriers have been flying to the United States and take effect immediately. Reuters U.S. to revise Chinese passenger airline ban -sources The U.S. Transportation Department plans to issue a revised order in the coming days that is likely to allow some Chinese passenger airline flights to continue, government and airline officials said.  On Thursday, China said it would ease coronavirus restrictions to allow more foreign carriers to fly to the mainland, shortly after Washington said it planned to bar Chinese passenger airlines from flying to the United States by June 16 due to Beijing\u2019s curbs on U.S. airlines.  The announcement should allow U.S. carriers to resume once-a-week flights into a city of their choosing starting on June 8. Advertise With Us \u00a9 2020 Verizon Media. All rights reserved.

Global stock markets have followed the U.S. higher overnight on increasing signs that the Covid-19 pandemic is peaking. Oil prices are also rising again on hopes that major producers will cobble together a deal on cutting output by Friday. The euro zone's finance ministers are set for another bust-up over common debt issuance, and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is stable and conscious after a night in intensive care being treated for Covid-19. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, April 7th. 1. Gold hits highest since 2012 Gold prices hit their highest in nearly eight years, as a wave of money continued to flood into exchange-traded funds, bars and coins on expectations of a prolonged period of low or negative interest rates. Gold futures for delivery on the Comex exchange hit a high of $1,742.20 a troy ounce overnight before retracing to hold just above $1,702 an ounce by 6:35 AM ET (1035 GMT). The premium over spot gold prices in London widened to almost $50 an ounce, amid further reports of trouble in sourcing enough physical gold to cover all the claims of U.S.-registered ETFs. The latest surge came on the back of reports on Monday that the U.S. is preparing a fourth economic support package that could be worth around $1.4 trillion. The sharp widening of budget deficits in the U.S. and Europe to fund the response to the Covid-19 crisis has encouraged heavy betting on currency debasement \u2013 even though most economists agree that the near-term effect of the crisis is more likely to be deflationary, rather than inflationary. 2. Oil rises further on hopes of output restraint deal Crude oil prices rebounded again amid hopes that the world\u2019s major producers will somehow cobble together an agreement to cut supply at a virtual meeting on Thursday. U.S. crude futures rose 3.1% to $26.91 a barrel, while Brent rose 2.4% to $33.83. Reuters quoted sources within the OPEC+ format (which includes Russia) as saying that an agreement is likely, as long as other countries - most of all, the U.S. \u2013 join in. Other reports suggested that the OPEC+ countries also want cuts from Canada and Brazil. The inability of the U.S. government to impose a nationwide output cut has led some analysts to suspect that the deal will aim to target a price that is still low enough to squeeze marginal U.S. shale producers into bankruptcy. Some have observed that the current use of drilling rigs is consistent with a drop in U.S. production of 1 million barrels a day by the third quarter. A meeting of G20 energy, which would include all the countries relevant to the discussion except Norway, is scheduled for Friday. 3. Stocks set to open higher as U.S. support package, European virus data lift spirits U.S. stocks are set to open markedly higher again, supported by the reports of a fourth economic support package that broke in the U.S. afternoon on Monday. The news, which helped to allay doubts about holes in the packages announced so far, drove one of the biggest ever rallies in the Dow Jones Industrials on Monday, pushing all the benchmark indices over 7% higher. By 6:35 AM ET, the Dow Jones 30 Futures was up 804 points, or 3.6%, while the S&P 500 futures contract was up 3.1% and the Nasdaq 100 futures contract was up 2.9%. European and Asian markets have also rallied, taking their lead from the U.S. and from increasing data points in Europe that suggest the Covid-19 epidemic is peaking. Spain posted four straight days of declining deaths, while Italy and Germany announced further falls in new infections, and Denmark joined Austria in planning to lift some of its lockdown restrictions. 4. Johnson remains in intensive care U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains stable and conscious in intensive care, after being hospitalized on Sunday evening in London. Against a backdrop of growing doubt about the reliability of information being provided by the government Cabinet Minister Michael Gove insisted on Tuesday that the Prime Minister was not on a ventilator and promised a full statement in case his situation gets any worse. Story continues Sterling and U.K. stocks were equally unfussed by the episode, joining in a broad risk-on rally in European markets. European Union finance ministers are due to hold another conference call about their pandemic response later Tuesday. 5. Fed moves to ease EM squeeze with $60 billion repo line to Indonesia The Federal Reserve agreed to provide a $60 billion repo line to Indonesia, whose financial markets have suffered some of the worst stress in the emerging world as the Covid-19 virus has spread across one of Asia\u2019s most important economies. The country has been criticized for its relatively low level of testing for Covid-19 among its population of over 200 million. The official death toll of 221 is widely believed to understate the actual number (as in many countries, due to the exclusion of victims who do not die in hospitals). The dollar had risen by some 20% against the Indonesian rupiah since the virus exploded in January. It has made similar, if less dramatic gains against many other emerging currencies, as markets price in a sudden stop of capital flows due to the looming recession. According to data from the International Institute for Finance in Washington, investors pulled some $83 billion from emerging markets in March alone.

No worries... Reply Replies (5) 11 M Morris The company also expects to recognize 500-560 MW as well as positive cash generation in Q3. For Q4 and after the expected Maxeon spinoff, both companies expect continued improvement in the global solar demand environment through the end of the year.

We will see a nice upgrade from Goldman Sachs. They have been working with Sunpower on a lot of projects Reply Replies (3) 9 1 T Tony Nice Earnings. Great to see positive cash flow generation Reply 10 G Guy So it's official. SEC has approved the registration statement. As of August 26 SPWR will distribute to shareholders of record on August 17th one Maxeon share for every 8 shares held at close of business on the 17th. Reply Replies (1) 16 J JamesP ENPH sold off after earnings yesterday and then closed today at $75!  The bottom line is a GAAP net profit during the worst quarter in economic history.  Spin-off will be completed this month.  We are moving up. Reply 12 1 J John Interesting notes from the ENPH call: (1) overall solar market picking up substantially since June, California is almost all the way back (good for SPWR market leadership in California new homes) (2) Internationally, France in particular has been really good (great for SPWR with Total (3) Encharge battery interest significantly higher than expected with an 8-10% projected attach rate (SPWR has forecast a 5% residential attach rate) Reply 11 J JamesP I'm fine with the price holding AH!  Onward to the spinoff!!  Again, I believe that TZS and many others around the world will be interested in ownig Maxeon shares.  If Total has 38% and TJS 28%, that's 66% of the outstanding.  That doesn't leave much to go around. Reply 6 C Corey With a good ER, this has a chance to really explode. 1/8 share dividend in new company, all solar stocks are exploding higher, a great partner in Total, the low float and high number is short sellers have to be scared because this could easily run to $20 in a matter of hours!    Huge opportunity with this stock because it is considerably undervalued compared to the solar peers. Bullish Reply Replies (1) 7 C Corey Tomorrow is going to be really good. We just heard one of the executives say that they are breaking weekly records for volume growth in July and into Aug. This stock will run up with the Maxeon spin off and new shares being issued to SunPower holders. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the huge EPS beat! Watch the shorts tomorrow. They are going to be silent and crying. More Reply 5 J John Today natural gas quietly made a 2020 YTD high.  A lot of analysts are starting to call for a sustained rally in nat gas prices as crude around $40 requires substantial production stoppage for frackers, reducing nat gas supply.  This is THE reference point for solar grid parity in terms of levelized cost of energy.  Good news and something to keep an eye on. Reply Replies (1) 13 J Jayveer1988 The goal of this message board should be to bring confidence to hold SPWR longterm. The longterm growth will be huge. We can all make 10x our investment, but it will take time. Be willing to wait 2-3 years. I can almost say for certain we will get there. Reply 5 Y Yel Upon consummation of the spin-off, our primary focus will include: \u2022 Increasing the production capacity of Maxeon 5 and 6. The brownfield build-out of Maxeon\u00a05 and 6, leveraging existing facilities and operational expertise combined with increased scale and simplified process, is expected to deliver 50% reductions in capital intensity and factory space requirements as well as reduced cell conversion cost (as compared to the Maxeon 2 technology that it is replacing). \u2022 Maxeon 7 future opportunity. Maxeon 7, currently in development, has the potential to achieve further process simplification and reduction in capital expenditures and cell conversion cost. \u2022 Enhancing our access to the low-cost Asia-centric supply chain and expanding our global channels to market. We will have access to our strategic partner TZS\u2019s knowledge of upstream supply markets and distribution channels in Asia. In addition, we will be able to leverage access to TZS\u2019s silicon wafers to enhance our Performance Line and Maxeon Line technologies. \u2022 Optimizing our strategic supply relationships with SunPower and Huansheng. We believe that the maintenance and optimization of our current strategic supply relationships are crucial to support our current global leadership position along with maintaining our exposure to key and growing markets worldwide. \u2022 Leveraging our established distributed generation channels to drive continued growth. As a leading distributed generation player, we have a robust sales and marketing platform to access key markets around the world. The expansion of this network is a vital element for future growth. \u2022 Enhancing our financial performance through our superior technology, manufacturing processes and strategy. We believe we have the ability to translate our superior technology into strong financial returns as we couple our premium average selling prices with enhanced manufacturing processes and a scalable low-cost footprint, resulting in rapidly expanding margins and cash generation. \u2022 Increasing our capital efficiency and establishing direct access to capital markets. As part of the planned separation, we seek to enhance our capital efficiency, as well as improve strategic alignment with our stakeholders through direct access to capital markets. Initial funding of full technological transformation to Maxeon 5 and 6 is key to growing our market leading position. More Reply Replies (2) 14 1 J JamesP Going into today cautiously optimistic - although I know the setup is as good as its ever been with the spin-off pretty much a certainty, the 2nd quarter behind us, the long term supply agreement winding down, the renewables market evolution in full swing, etc, I\u2019ve been thru too many disappointments to believe that I am all-in, heavily invested in a stock that is going to literally take off.

They have to be. In a recession, there's typically not a lot of money for much else. No one has officially announced a recession yet - it usually takes six months to determine a recession has actually occurred . But according to 45 different economists , the U.S. is indeed in the midst of a recession. The National Association for Business Economics expects economic growth fell 2.4% in Q1, and will drop 26.5% in Q2. While those same economists believe the U.S. economy will rebound in the second half of the year, the global picture isn't so bright. The International Monetary Fund believes the world economy will remain in a weakened state all year, with GDP contracting 3% - well below its January projection of 3.3% growth - before rebounding with 5.8% growth in 2021. The companies best suited to survive, if not thrive, in this kind of environment, are defensive stocks that provide products and services people simply can't live without. With this in mind, here are 20 best stocks to invest in during a recession. Some of these might not be the greatest stocks to hold once the U.S. and global economies have returned to normal. But all of them have loads of worth - to investors and consumers alike - as long as times are tight. SEE ALSO: 25 Blue Chips With Brawny Balance Sheets Walmart View photos Getty Images Market value: $364.7 billion Dividend yield: 1.7% Analysts' opinion: 20 Strong Buy, 5 Buy, 7 Hold, 0 Sell, 1 Strong Sell Walmart ( WMT , $128.76) CEO Doug McMillion appeared on The Today Show on April 10 to discuss coronavirus-sparked panic buying. First, consumers ordered food and other consumables. Then, they turned to entertainment items such as jigsaw puzzles and board games. Now, they're ordering hair coloring and beard trimmers. All of these are things that you can buy at Walmart. Thus while many companies have suffered tremendous financial hardship during this crisis, Walmart is among the major U.S. corporations actually hiring en masse to keep up with increased demand. Specifically, WMT plans on hiring 150,000 new workers, and it might need to expand past that. Of those jobs, about 80% to 85% are temporary in nature. However, that still means as many as 22,500 people could stay with Walmart on a permanent basis once the crisis ends. That's good for employees. That's good for the employer. Back in 2008, Slate magazine wondered why Walmart was thriving while the economy was tanking. The answer: Consumers could no longer afford to trade up; they were forced to survive by trading down. The 2020 recession could spark a similar trend, putting more money in the Walton family's bank accounts. During the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, Walmart's stock delivered 9% on a total-return basis (price plus dividends). By comparison, the S&P 500 lost 34% over the same period. It looks like WMT might be one of the best stocks to invest in this time around, too. Since the bull-market peaked Feb. 19, Walmart's stock has posted a 9.9% total return versus a 17.5% decline for the index. There could be plenty more where that came from. SEE ALSO: 19 Dividend Aristocrats That Have Gone on Deep Discount Story continues Dollar General View photos Getty Images Market value: $44.3 billion Dividend yield: 0.8% Analysts' opinion: 19 Strong Buy, 1 Buy, 6 Hold, 1 Sell, 0 Strong Sell Just as it it's a good sign Walmart is bringing on workers, the fact that Dollar General ( DG , $176.11) is hiring 50,000 people by the end of April bodes well, too. Although many of the 50,000 jobs will be temporary, the discount retailer has added net new jobs of 35,000 over the past five years - an indication that some of the temporary workers might stay beyond the coronavirus. As far back as August, investment professionals began to tout Dollar General as a stock to own during a recession. \"The good news is consumers often shop more at the dollar stores during periods of economic weakness,\" Mark DeVaul, portfolio manager at the Hennessy Equity and Income Fund ( HEIFX ), stated in August 2019 . \"We wouldn't expect a sharp increase in sales, but we suspect sales will remain stable at the dollar stores while other companies may feel greater pain.\" In Dollar General's latest fiscal year, 78% of its revenue was from consumables, which includes a large number of products that consumers are going to want to buy for less during a recession. The idea that dollar stores might be some of the best stocks to invest in amid a recession isn't just a lazy assumption. Dollar General's biggest competitor, Dollar Tree ( DLTR ), delivered an almost 200% return between December 2008 and December 2011 - five times the performance of the S&P 500. Dollar General didn't come public until November 2019, but its same-store sales improved by more than 9% in 2008 and 2009. It's abundantly clear these companies are tailor-made for tough economic times.

Though, when you think about the fact that consumers have been pulling back on sugary sodas for years, PepsiCo's ( PEP , $135.03) doesn't feel like a clear-cut winner. However, the company hasn't ignored the changing tastes of consumers. In addition to its legacy soft drinks, it also sells Gatorade, Lipton iced teas, Tropicana juices, Bubly sparkling water, Naked smoothies, Aquafina water and Starbucks ( SBUX ) bottled drinks via a partnership with the coffee giant. Not to mention its enormous Frito-Lay snacks division, as well as Quaker Oats products. PepsiCo grew overall earnings by 3.9% on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis in fiscal 2019, and 4.5% on an organic basis, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency. A big driver of that growth was the company's Frito-Lay North America division, which grew revenues by 4.5%. But where the snack-food business really contributed was its 5% increase in operating profit to $5.26 billion, or 51% of its total for the year. By comparison, PepsiCo Beverages North America had revenues that were 27% higher than Frito-Lay's, but operating profits that were 59% less. Without snacks, 2019 would have looked a lot different. Back in 2009, Harvard Business Review covered how PepsiCo would deal with a recession: \"PepsiCo's goal is to reinvigorate its carbonated soft drink category with substantially increased marketing investments in Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and other products. These investments include a new upbeat 'Optimism' ad campaign, new packaging, and new point-of-purchase materials. PepsiCo also plans to increase activity in digital media specifically to target the youthful live-for-today segment.\" That could educate what Pepsi does in the months ahead. While a CEO's first instinct is to cut costs across the board, it's vital that PepsiCo ensure that Frito-Lay, its extremely profitable business, remains in the good graces of consumers. So investors might expect the company to pour significant resources into its snack business in the coming recession while finding places to cut costs elsewhere.

While Hershey ( HSY , $142.60) might not be able to fully avoid taking a hit in a recession, it did a pretty good job in 2008. That year, Hershey reported sales of $5.13 billion, 3.8% higher than in 2007. Hershey produced a $311 million profit out of that, or 45.3% higher than a year earlier. \"Most food companies in 2008 did well,\" Frost & Sullivan analyst Christopher Shanahan said in March 2009. \"Hershey was definitely one of the leaders.\" Yes, HSY shares lost 6%, including dividends, during the Great Recession. But it outperformed the S&P 500 by 28 percentage points, and depending on when they entered, some investors actually squeezed gains out of Hershey. Interestingly, Hershey increased its advertising in 2008, similar to what Pepsi did with its soft drinks. In times of difficulty, you have to stay front of mind with the consumer because if you don't, someone else will grab your customers. Equally important, HSY upped prices for its products, helping to offset higher input costs. Should we go through an extended recession as a result of COVID-19, Hershey - which is outperforming the market by 7 percentage points since the bear market started - might bring out the same playbook. As a result, HSY might be one of the best stocks to invest in over the next year or so.

But it's doing considerably better than its defense peers, as Boeing ( BA ) and a few others have led the iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF ( ITA ) down a gaudy 36.1%. Lockheed Martin is one of the better defensive plays in a recession because it generates a huge chunk of its sales from the Department of Defense, which is slated to spend $738 billion in 2020. Of that, approximately 90% goes to U.S. companies such as Lockheed Martin. During the Great Recession, while consumer spending declined 8.2%, defense spending increased by 12.2%. Further, between 1970 and 2009, out of six recessions, defense spending increased in all but one. No one should be surprised to hear that LMT generates roughly 70% of its annual revenue from the U.S. government. In fact, Lockheed Martin accounts for 28% of the DoD's total spending. While many companies are laying off employees, Lockheed Martin has added 1,000 new employees during the coronavirus crisis, with an ongoing search to fill another 5,000 open positions. Lockheed Martin, then, should be among the most recession-proof stocks to invest in. One last note: Investors might be worried that in mid-March, the company announced CEO Marilyn Hewson, who has run the company since 2013, would be replaced June 15 by James Taiclet, who has helmed American Tower ( AMT ) since 2003. But you don't make a leadership change during this kind of crisis unless you're confident your business is able to weather the challenges ahead.

O'Reilly has done a good job of balancing its revenues between DIY customers and professional shops; the business model has held ORLY in good stead for decades. Last year's revenues were split 55% to do-it-your customers and 45% to owners of automotive repair shops. During a recession, it's possible that sales to DIY customers will increase as people choose to save money by doing their own repairs. In early March, before the coronavirus decimated stocks, investors bid up share prices of companies like O'Reilly because of their natural resilience during recessions. \"The market is reading this as, no one will be buying new cars for a while,\" Kevin Tynan, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, told Bloomberg News . \"If consumers are retrenching, they will keep their cars longer. There is a natural resilience to these companies.\" In October 2019, Kiplinger's Personal Finance Associate Editor Ryan Ermey discussed how the company survived the disruption that Amazon.com ( AMZN ) was expected to bring to the car-parts business when the e-commerce giant entered the fray in 2017. While ORLY sank on initial fears, it has since doubled from its 2017 lows - even accounting for this year's losses. And so far through the current bear market, O'Reilly's stock has declined less than 10%. ORLY should hold its own and earn its place among stocks to invest in for the coming recession.

During the week ended March 21, alcohol sales were up 55% compared to the same period a year earlier. Even more impressive, online liquor sales were up 243%. They cooled off a little for the week ended March 28, with overall sales up 22%. However, online liquor sales grew by 291% year-over-year, suggesting that not every industry is hurting in these challenging times. Diageo ( DEO , $132.69), the world's largest maker of branded premium spirits, saw a similar trend in March 2009. Its U.S. business improved despite the country being in the midst of a recession. \"We see growth continuing even in this difficult environment and expect industry growth staying in the range of 0-1 percent for sales volumes,\" Ivan Menezes, Diageo's head of its North American operations and current CEO, told Reuters in 2009 . \"The consumer shift is toward strong brands with strong credentials and strong heritage.\" Diageo - whose brands include Johnnie Walker, Crown Royal, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan and Guinness - has performed in line with the market so far in the downturn. But if liquor sales remain strong, Diageo's stock should pull away.

In fact, that's when its stock started trading: Altria ( MO ) spun off its international business on March 27, 2008. Shareholders got one new share of PM for every share of MO they owned. Philip Morris' shares traded roughly flat between then and the end of the bear market, versus a 20%-plus loss for the S&P 500. Philip Morris - and most other major cigarette companies, for that matter - benefited from increased sales during the Great Recession. \"The sales records of these tobacco companies demonstrate that smokers not only continued to smoke but also actually increased their cigarette intake during this period of economic difficulty, despite the harm to everyone caused by exposure to this habit,\" Teikyo University School of Medicine professors Peisen He and Eiji Yano wrote in their June 2009 article, \"Tobacco companies are booming despite an economic depression.\" Several factors have changed since then, of course. The world's attitudes toward smoking have changed considerably over the past decade. Not to mention, the coronavirus's effect on respiratory systems might make even diehard smokers a little wary at this time. But Philip Morris has been working to counter the anti-smoking trend by replacing cigarettes with smoke-free products, such as its IQOS electronic device that heats tobacco instead of burning it. PM also claims IQOS reduces the levels of harmful chemicals ingested compared to cigarettes. The company says roughly 9.7 million people \"have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS.\" In 2019, its heated tobacco shipment volume increased 44% over the previous year to 59.7 billion units. By 2021, it expects to reach its goal of 90 billion to 100 billion units. It's too early to tell how the coronavirus has affected Philip Morris' overall sales. But the company's pivot away from cigarettes should pay dividends in good times and bad.

Money, mostly,\" The Atlantic's Olga Khazan wrote in September 2014 . \"Derek Thompson has previously written how the recession was like a big pause button on the lives of Millennials.\" \"It costs a quarter of a million dollars to raise a child, so laid-off couples might have been extra-scrupulous with their birth control between 2008 and 2011.\" It just so happens that household and personal products company Church & Dwight ( CHD , $72.00) makes Trojan condoms, the leading condom manufacturer in the U.S. with about 70% market share. However, Trojan isn't Church & Dwight's only power brand. It has 11 other major brands that capture significant market share in their respective categories and collectively generate 80% of the company's overall revenues. They include Arm & Hammer baking soda, OxyClean laundry stain remover, First Response pregnancy tests, Orajel oral care, Waterpik power flossers, and Spinbrush power toothbrushes. Church & Dwight actually improved its earnings per share between 2007 and 2009 by consumers with value pricing at a time when they could really use a break. In good times and bad, people always like a good deal. CHD is hardly cheap at almost 4 times sales, but it's a consistent performer, and that makes it one of the best stocks to invest in during a recession. SEE ALSO: Investing in Stocks?

General Mills - which is responsible for numerous big brands including Cheerios, Pillsbury, Totino's, Betty Crocker, Yoplait and Annie's Homegrown - did just fine during the Great Recession. \"We're continuing to see strong consumer demand for our products in markets around the world,\" former CEO Ken Powell said in the company's fiscal Q2 2009 release , issued in December 2008. \"Our segment operating profit margin held steady despite higher input costs and the strong double-digit increase in consumer marketing to support our brands. Performance through the first half of 2009 has us solidly on track to deliver strong sales and earnings growth for the year.\" In fact, Powell raised the company's earnings guidance for 2009 by 4 cents per share to $3.87. It finished fiscal 2009 with $3.98 in EPS, 11 cents higher than its guidance for the year. Now, as we've entered another recession, current CEO Jeff Harmening is quite optimistic about its chances. \"It's been so long since we had a recession and especially here in the U.S. But certainly, during that time, people tend to eat in more, and General Mills did quite well,\" Harmening said during the company's March earnings call. \"But that was a decade ago. We'll see how it plays out this time.\" Because of increased demand for its cereals, frozen products and pet foods during the coronavirus, General Mills expects its 2020 EPS to increase by 6% to 8% in the current fiscal year - much higher than its previous projection of 3% to 5%.

The global consumer staples company - whose brands include Dove soap, Hellmann's condiments, Axe personal care products and Breyers ice cream - grew revenues by 2.9%. The Home Care operating segment, which includes brands such as Cif and Sun, led that growth with a 6.1% bump in sales. Free cash flow swelled by 13% to 6.1 billion euros. Unilever has focused on global brands it believes can be juiced for even more sales. As a result, it has undertaken a strategic review of its tea business, which could be sold in 2020. Paul Polman, who was CEO of Unilever during the Great Recession, found the company's business ideally suited to fight off a recession. \"Consumers postpone buying cars, televisions and that frees up a lot of money to spend on everyday needs. We don't see personal care or food markets go down substantially,\" Polman said in March 2009. Between 2008 and 2010, Unilever's sales grew from 22.1 billion euros to 23.58 billion euros, though operating profits did fall by 13.5% over that time. Still, as we move into a recession, it's likely that consumer discretionary spending will slow substantially. Some of that should be redirected to Unilever's products. Clorox View photos Getty Images Market value: $24.5 billion Dividend yield: 2.2% Analysts' opinion: 3 Strong Buy, 0 Buy, 7 Hold, 1 Sell, 4 Strong Sell Clorox ( CLX , $195.64) has been among the best stocks to ride out the coronavirus outbreak , would have to be it. The company has produced a nearly 19% total return since Feb. 19 while the index has retreated by almost as much. Pardon the pun, but it's wiping the floor with most other U.S.-listed stocks. That's not surprising given that Clorox's disinfectant wipes and bleach have been flying off the shelves. The company controls approximately 50% of the market for disinfectant wipes. In times of crisis, consumers tend to stick with brand names they know, opting to pass on cheaper, store brands. \"Based on conversations with retail buyers, we estimate COVID-19 related demand could boost baseline disinfectant category trends by 3-5x in the next few months as retailers work to rebuild inventory and stay in stock,\" UBS analyst Steven Strycula wrote in mid-March. Further, according to Deutsche Bank data going back to the 1990s, consumer staples stocks such as Clorox tend to outperform the S&P 500 in recessions and other difficult periods. Between 2007 and 2009, Clorox's earnings expanded by 24%. The company also treated income investors to a 35% bump in its annual dividend payments (distributed quarterly) over that time. It has since extended that streak to 42 consecutive years, including a 10% raise last year, putting it among the Dividend Aristocrats . \"Rewarding our stockholders has always been a priority,\" CEO Benno Dorer said in a May 20 press release. \"This double-digit increase in our dividend is on top of last year's 14% increase. It represents an ongoing effort to put our strong cash flow generation to work, which emphasizes investing in long-term business growth and returning excess cash to our stockholders.\" Considering business is stronger than it has been in some time, investors can expect increase No. 43 later this year.

They're products we use every day: Oral B toothbrushes, Ivory soap, Crest toothpaste, Head & Shoulders shampoo. The list goes on and on. P&G pointed out in a February presentation that during the first half of its 2020 fiscal year, all eight of its operating segments posted positive organic sales growth. Its Skin & Personal Care and Personal Health Care businesses led the charge with 13% and 11% growth, respectively. Those include brands such as Gillette, Ivory, Pepto Bismol and Vicks. In the first half of 2020, Procter & Gamble expected organic sales growth of 3% to 4% and core earnings per share growth of 4% to 8%. It delivered 6% and 18% growth, respectively, far in excess of its projections. As people stay home during the coronavirus, when they do go out to the grocery store and pharmacy, you can be sure they'll buy numerous P&G products. And the company in general is in a good position, according to P&G CFO Jon Moeller. \"We are better positioned for several reasons to deal with (an economic) downturn than we were in 2007,\" Moeller told CNBC in October. \"We'll use tools like value messaging, pack sizes, performance messaging to ensure that if there is a downturn, we are in the best position for a consumer in a pinch. ... We don't see consumers stopping laundry or shampooing or conditioning or feminine protection during a recession.\" Procter & Gamble further instilled confidence by stating in mid-April that it would hike its dividend for the 64th consecutive year, doling out a 6% increase. At a time when some companies are announcing dividend cuts or suspensions , you can count on P&G's 2.6% yield.

Hormel ( HRL , $48.66) announced in late March that it would pay out more than $4 million in special cash bonuses to all full- and part-time workers that man the production lines at its various plants, ensuring that Americans don't go hungry. \"As a global branded food company, we play a critical role in providing safe, high-quality food during this unprecedented time,\" CEO Jim Snee said. \"Our incredible team of more than 13,000 plant professionals is the backbone of our company and this special bonus is one way we can continue to thank them for how they have risen to the challenge and continue to produce food with a sense of purpose and pride.\" As part of the bonus program, in which each full-time worker gets a $300 bonus and every part-time worker gets $150, also has extended paid sick leave for any employees who can't make it to work as a result of the virus. During the Great Recession, Hormel's results were mixed, as consumers balked at some of its more upscale products. \"We are seeing some ups and downs in terms of demand for our products - very strong demand for the canned side of the franchise, Spam luncheon meat, Hormel chili, Dinty Moore beef stew,\" former Hormel CEO Jeffrey Ettinger said in March 2009 . In February, before the coronavirus took hold, Hormel's guidance for fiscal 2020 were net sales of at least $9.5 billion and EPS of $1.69. Refrigerated Products, its Jennie-O Turkey Store and Grocery Products (such as Spam) were expected to lead the way. Hormel is one of the best stocks to invest in during a recession simply because it shouldn't get slaughtered. In fact, it actually has put together a small gain in this bear market while many blue-chip stocks are sitting on double-digit declines.

It did better than expected. In 2007, Costco boasted 27,500 total primary cardholders. Two years later, Costco finished fiscal 2009 with 30,600 primary cardholders - an 11.3% gain. \"There were expectations that people would be willing to let their memberships expire, but the numbers have held up quite well,\" Morningstar retail analyst R.J. Hottovy said in January 2010 . As America makes its way through the coronavirus recession, Costco remains one of the better-positioned retailers during and after the crisis. In the five weeks ended April 5, Costco saw its same-store sales increase a whopping 12.3%. Analysts actually expected them to be as high as 24.1% as members hoarded everything from toilet paper to orange juice. However, it seems that once the social distancing rules kicked in for much of the country in mid-March, traffic to its stores slowed. Despite this, Costco's foot traffic for all of March increased by 5.3%. One thing that's going to help Costco as the recession wears on wasn't even a big contributor back in the Great Recession: online sales. In the second quarter ended Feb. 16, Costco's online same-store sales increased by 28% over the same period a year earlier. In the month of March, they improved by a whopping 48.3%. Costco is projected to generate $8.3 billion in e-commerce sales in 2020, versus annual online revenues of just $1 billion in 2007.

The company says its same-store sales jumped 30% year-over-year in March, spiking in the middle of the month because of customer hoarding. \"The demand has been broad based across grocery and fresh departments,\" Kroger said in a release. \"It is too early to speculate what will emerge as the 'new normal' in food consumption at home or what the impact on sales will be in future periods.\" Kroger now expects its first-quarter same-store sales (typically revenues generated at stores open longer than 12 months) to be higher than originally expected. In the Great Recession, Kroger reported healthy earnings as a result of changes in customer routines such as eating out less, entertaining at home and buying more private-label store-branded items. Equally important, Kroger did well against the mighty Walmart. \"In 33 markets where the Supercenters have a third-place market share in the grocery sector, and Kroger is either number one or two, Kroger's share of grocery sales in those areas rose 8.6 percent year over year during the fourth-quarter period,\" CBS reported on March 12, 2009. If the last recession is any indication, Kroger will benefit. So far, it's sprinting past the market with an 8% gain since Feb. 19.

In the case of McDonald's ( MCD , $177.84), which is so big that it likely doesn't fear much, we're likely to see a few new tricks out of a company that has always been well ahead of the curve. McDonald's opened almost 600 stores in 2008. Further, its 2008 sales were higher than both 2006 and 2007. Between December 2007 and June 2009, MCD stock delivered a total return of 2.5%, considerably higher than the 35% loss in the S&P 500. Americans traded down in the last recession. McDonald's was ideally positioned to benefit from this trend. \"In a recession, people eat out less and at home more frequently. And when they eat out, they eat at cheaper places,\" Slate contributor Daniel Gross wrote in August 2009 . \"McDonald's is so cheap, efficient, pervasive and convenient that it was a viable alternative to casual restaurants like Ruby Tuesday and to cooking at home. Investors, like diners, angled toward McDonald's and away from Ruby Tuesday during the recession.\" As this current likely recession continues, analysts believe defensive plays like McDonald's make sense. \"We believe MCD is well-positioned to perform strongly on a relative basis in this scenario (recession) when considering global comps for McDonald's during 2008-2009 were a recession-resilient +5.4% (best-performing brand in our coverage universe),\" Baird Equity Research analysts wrote in an April note to clients. The Baird analysts argue that McDonald's projected cash balance at the end of March will be almost $7 billion. With further relief from the economic stimulus package, the Golden Arches is more than prepared to fight through a recession. Rollins View photos Getty Images Market value: $12.1 billion Dividend yield: 1.3% Analysts' opinion: 1 Strong Buy, 0 Buy, 3 Hold, 0 Sell, 0 Strong Sell Kiplinger listed Rollins ( ROL , $36.85) as one of 15 recession-resistant stocks to own in October. So far, so good. The stock is off just 7% through the bear market, outperforming the S&P 500 by a little more than 10 percentage points. Back in 2008, Rollins grew its various pest control businesses, including the Orkin brand, by a healthy 3%. In good times and bad, individuals and businesses will pay for pest removal. Rollins rolled into 2020 with momentum. Its 2019 sales grew by 10.6% to $2.02 billion, and it increased its dividend or the 18th consecutive year. Then in late March, Rollins announced that it was launching Orkin VitalClean, which provides customers with a disinfectant for suppressing a wide range of germs including those that cause the coronavirus, swine flu and avian flu. It's especially useful for removing bacteria and viruses from hard, non-porous surfaces such as stainless steel. This service could be a hit with consumers in the current environment. As for Rollins' growth strategy: It's a combination of organic revenue growth from its 2.4 million residential and commercial customers along with acquisitions of other pest control businesses in the U.S. and around the world. As the coronavirus hurts other businesses in the industry, it's likely that Rollins will be open to further acquisitions. Moreover, with just $561 million in contractual obligations, $94 million in cash and $133 million available under its revolving credit and term loan facilities, Rollins has plenty of liquidity to get it through this recession. One last wild card that puts Rollins among the best stocks to invest in during this recession? The Rollins family owns 53.2% of the company's shares. Family-controlled businesses tend to believe in long-term planning, and that bodes well for survivability.

The thousands of people who've died from the virus have either made pre-death funeral arrangements or their loved ones are making them. In New York City, the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., funeral homes are overwhelmed by the number of clients they're seeing as a result of this crisis. Service Corporation International ( SCI , $38.21), an owner of more than 1,900 funeral homes and cemeteries in 44 states and eight Canadian provinces, ought to have momentum as it attempts to navigate the recession. In June 2019, as recession talk was heating up, Bank of America analyst Joanna Gajuk suggested that companies like Service Corp only suffered a \"slight pullback\" in their business during the Great Recession. The reasoning? Roughly 75% of funeral home clients who pay for funeral arrangements ahead of time pay a lump sum. In addition, 40% to 50% pay ahead of time for cemetery plots, also in one lump sum. In 2019, Service Corp finished the year with free cash flow of $390 million and a free cash flow margin of 12.1%. It expects to grow sales by 8% to 12% in 2020, filtering down to earnings of $1.96 to $2.16 a share. Curiously, SCI shares are among the few recession stocks on this list that are underperforming the index during this downturn. It's too early to know how the coronavirus will affect Service Corp's business, but the two analysts that have sounded off over the past month still consider SCI a buy. Both have price targets implying more than 20% upside from current prices.

According to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, nearly 60% of taxpayers use a tax practitioner to prepare their annual tax return. H&R Block ( HRB , $13.52) happens to be one of the largest tax practitioners in the U.S., Canada and Australia. Every year, the other 40% of Americans put themselves through the annual ritual of preparing their own taxes. In 2020, as the pandemic rages, those that have traditionally done their own taxes could decide to hand over their return to a professional to lessen the anxiety of self-preparation. One service H&R Block provides that should benefit from the coronavirus is Tax Pro Go, which allows clients to upload their documents using their smartphone. The H&R Block tax pro does the rest. And if you still want to prepare your own return, HRB offers the online tools to help you do that. H&R Block's results might be spread out more than usual this year, however. The IRS has extended this year's federal filing deadline to July 15 , and most states have followed suit. But they still want to hear from taxpayers, recession or not. HRB lost about 14 percentage points less than the S&P 500 during the Great Recession, and in a choppy fashion that allowed many investors to exit with gains. In H&R Block's 2009 fiscal year ended April 30, 2009, the company's sales were flat at $4.08 billion, while its operating income actually increased by 15% to $513.06 million. What will happen in this recession is very much up in the air. What we do know is that H&R Block's strongest quarter of the year in 2020 won't look how it normally does, as Americans spread out their filing duties into the summer.

Getting the short end of the stick. Short-sighted. Those trite expressions might describe how people who piled into short positions in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) stock feel now as shares skyrocket in a rally that\u2019s nothing short of hyperbolic. Before shares began their feverish climb in December 2019, TSLA was among the most heavily \u201cshorted\u201d companies on the market. Now, anyone who had a short position\u2014betting on shares to fall\u2014is either holding on for dear life or already jumped ship as the stock rose as much as 20% a day the first week of February. CNBC even added it to their main ticker flash on the screen along with the major indices. A year ago, the stock was down in the dumps and every article was negative. Now it\u2019s the darling of Wall Street and every article is positive. Why is this happening to TSLA shares, and why now?\u00a0 There\u2019s a bunch of possible reasons, but a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d is one of the main ones. Whether you can call TSLA\u2019s price action a short\u00a0squeeze\u00a0may be up for debate. But the classic signs are there: A dynamic narrative, a case for massive growth as well a case for financial stress, and deep pockets having lined up on both sides of the trade. Here\u2019s how to identify a squeeze and how you might want to play it (or not). The Short Squeeze Explained You\u2019re probably familiar with the terms \u201cshort selling,\u201d \u201cgoing short the stock market,\u201d \u201cshorting a stock,\u201d or \u201cselling stocks short.\u201d The aim when shorting a stock is to generate profit from stocks that decline in value. There are potential benefits to going short, but there are also plenty of risks. One big risk is when bullish news pushes a stock price higher, prompting short sellers to head for the exits all at once. As the shorts scramble to buy back and cover losses, upward momentum builds upon itself and the stock can move sharply higher. This is known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d What makes a short squeeze so dangerous? Think of it this way: When you buy a stock, the worst thing it can do is go to zero. Sure, in some of today's big-name stocks such as Google parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) which have shares trading around $1,400 and $2,000 per share respectively, it can be a long way to zero. But still, the upside is unlimited. If a stock has a growth narrative, and there are enough believers, today's share price can go well beyond what looks reasonable by traditional fundamental metrics. Or, as goes the old adage (widely attributed to economist John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s), \u201ca market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\u201d Even if a high-flyer does come back to earth in the long run, the shorts may be wiped out long before then. Or, in another quip by Lord Keynes, \u201cin the long run, we are all dead.\u201d TSLA does appear to be in the throes of a short squeeze. What you\u2019re getting here is people who are covering because they have to. That\u2019s what can cause things to get out of whack\u2014people making trades they don\u2019t want to make but have to. Ask yourself, \u201cwho would buy TSLA up here?\u201d The answer? Someone who\u2019s forced to. Someone who didn\u2019t have enough money to hold on any more, or someone whose pain threshold has been violated. The Squeeze Is On? Again, shorting a stock is complicated business. Since you can\u2019t sell something you don\u2019t own, shorting requires the seller to \u201cborrow\u201d the stock and pay interest to the stock lender), then sell it. Locating the shares can sometimes be difficult for your clearing firm, due to high demand or a small number of outstanding shares (\u201cthe float\u201d). Measuring a short squeeze can involve a metric called the short interest ratio, aka \"days to cover.\" It indicates, in days, how long it would take to cover, or buy back, all the shorted shares. Basically, you divide the number of shares sold short by the average daily trading volume. The longer the days to cover, the more pronounced this effect can be. But it's not the only story. TSLA, for example, has a relatively low short interest ratio as of February 4, 2020. But many traders see the activity as indicative of a squeeze (see figure 1 below). Story continues FIGURE 1: VOLUME AND FLOAT . Fundamental data available on the TD\u00a0Ameritrade platform can help you analyze the dynamics of a stock's price action. Source: TDAmeritrade.com. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Technical Analysis And Short Squeezes When markets show explosive activity, it\u2019s easy to see in hindsight. But there are tools that could help identify when the momentum could build up so you don\u2019t end up on the wrong side of the trade. On the thinkorswim platform, there's an indicator called TTM Squeeze, which can help identify when the transition between a consolidation and trend is likely to take place. Pull up a chart from the Charts tab on thinkorswim, select Studies > Add Study > All Studies > T\u2013U > TTM_Squeeze . In figure 2, the TTM Squeeze is plotted in the subchart below the price chart. FIGURE 2: AFTER THE SQUEEZE . After a period of compression, Tesla stock (TSLA-candlestick) started showing signs that perhaps it would start making an upward move. In early October 2019, the TTM Squeeze indicator (subchart) showed momentum building up in the stock. This coincided with the stock moving above its 20-period moving average (blue line). The stock has continued its upward move and has exploded well above the moving average. Data source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD\u00a0Ameritrade . For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The indicator (dots along zero line) is plotted with the Momentum Oscillator (cyan\u00a0vertical\u00a0bars). Notice how the oscillator gradually started moving above the zero line and the histogram bars were getting taller in height? This indicated a possible build-up of momentum. The dots plotted on the zero line are green, which suggests the market is ready to trend. Red dots suggest the market is tightening. If momentum is above the zero line, the direction of price movement is up and when it\u2019s below the zero line, price movement is likely to be down. It may be helpful to plot an additional indicator such as the moving average to confirm the trend. In this case the momentum was clearly building for an uptrend and as you can see from the chart, the momentum became extremely strong, pushing the stock price significantly higher. When might it slow down? Keep an eye on the TTM Squeeze indicator. Fundamental Files If you\u2019re buying TSLA here, especially at these levels, it helps to understand why the stock is moving. Aside from any short squeeze, that is. One analyst speculated that TSLA might soon join the S&P 500, which would mean some of the recent buying might be on hope that fund managers would have to jump in if that happens\u2014index funds must hold a commensurate amount of shares of all the index components. Another analyst was on the air Tuesday talking about the chance of eventual $1 trillion a year revenue for the company. Probably something people should take with a huge grain of salt. Another possible reason is that after years of sputtering, the company appears to finally be getting its financials into better shape. It\u2019s had two positive earnings quarters in a row, and its vehicle production and deliveries in 2019 met its own expectations. The company might be developing some trust with investors after scaring them away a few years ago with huge losses, promises it couldn\u2019t always keep, and some questionable public behavior by CEO Elon Musk that ended up getting him in trouble with the U.S. government. Now TSLA appears to be firing on most cylinders, and what we\u2019re seeing is the kind of market speculation that surrounds someone who can land a rocket ship on a barge in the middle of the ocean. People like Musk tend to get that kind of recognition. Playing The Squeeze? Hope You\u2019re Comfortable With Risk So you say you want to play TSLA in what might be a short squeeze? Here\u2019s some stuff to consider. Trading TSLA here is something that\u2019s OK to do as long as you understand the risk and how to control it. You can make small or big bets, but you have to control risk and limit it. Decide how much money you can lose in any trade. Also, people shouldn\u2019t underestimate how far this can go and how long it can take. Everyone believes TSLA will eventually correct, but to what price and when? That\u2019s what no one can answer. These things can go on for a while. All you have to do is look at the drought of 2012 in the grain markets. Grain futures then rose farther than anyone thought they could and stayed there a while. It was a short squeeze based on lack of volume, a drought that caused demand to go crazy, and speculation running rampant. One way to consider playing TSLA is in the options market. There\u2019s a piece of classic advice about limited risk: Want to get short exposure? Consider buying a put or put vertical, or selling a call vertical. For more on limited-risk options strategies, please refer to this primer . And remember: A short squeeze doesn\u2019t last forever and will eventually subside.

Much better, but the cost cutting did surprise in a positive way. Based on conf call there is a chance for just a bit more fat cutting but not much. I am a bit pleased that they offered guidance for the next quarter based on only 5 weeks of sales. So that\u2019s a positive. I am not surprised by the down action following earnings considering the revenue miss. Overall this investment for me is under water because my average is $0.98 or so on all my shares. Now that future dilution is not really in the cards other than already known convertibles and bankruptcy is not a risk I see this as a stock that is more likely to go up, rather than down over the next 6-9 months. Also politically there is more positive winds with the election coming up. Also for me this is a 2025 stock more than anything. I am long on the US MJ market.

My main concern with this earning release is the headline will be all about significant declines in revenue year over year and likely quarter over quarter. I think the company's path to profitability makes sense but that is going to take time.

The last earnings tells me that they are going in the right direction as far as moving towards profitability compared to the earnings before. That being said my personal decision is to wait once again for next earnings.  The way I see it there are likely a couple scenarios and I want to see which might play out. 1. Kush increases revenue but also increases expenses and gets no closer to profitability.. 2. Kush continues to have lower revenue and even with expenses lowered they are no closer to profitability... 3. Kush begins to regrow revenue and keep expenses down getting closer to profitability... 4. Kush has an unexpectedly good quarter in revenue and keeps expenses low enough to be profitable then or in the very near future. next earnings tells me which route they seem to be headed and If its closer to profitability I'm dumping more into it. I'm currently at $3.03 average (got in too early).. I buy and hold long. not looking to make a quick buck, but rather own a great company with a long future. GL to all.

The daily TCE of the fleet for the first six months of 2020 was $6,985 per ship per day, compared to $8,368 in the first six months of 2019. The average daily OPEX of the fleet was $5,353, reflecting a 9% increase against the respective period of 2019 mainly on the back of the increase noted in the OPEX figure for the first quarter of 2020 which was due to the timing of various related expenses. General and Administrative expenses in the first six months of 2020 stood at $3.1 million, in line with the $3.2 million recorded in the respective period in 2019.As of June 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash stood at $30.4 million, marking an 109% improvement against December 31, 2019. Shareholders\u2019 equity as of June 30, 2020 was $58 million, increased by 94% compared to $29.9 million as of December 31, 2019.Third Quarter 2020 TCE Guidance:Since the beginning of the third quarter of 2020, 88% of our available days (fleet ownership days less off-hire days due to surveys) have been fixed, at a daily TCE of approximately $22,4142 per ship per day, marking an increase of 221% as compared to the fleet average TCE rate of $6,985 in the first six months of 2020. During this period, 30% of our fleet is employed under voyage charters and 70% under Index-linked Time Charters.For the vessels being operated under voyage charters, spot estimates are provided using the load-to-discharge method of accounting. Load-to-discharge accounting recognizes revenues over fewer days as opposed to the discharge-to-discharge method of accounting used prior to 2018, resulting in higher rates for these days and only voyage expenses being recorded in the ballast days. Over the duration of the voyage (discharge-to-discharge) there is no difference in the total revenues and costs to be recognized. The rates quoted are for days currently contracted. Increased ballast days at the end of the quarter will reduce the additional revenues that can be booked based on the accounting cut-offs and therefore the resulting TCE will be reduced accordingly.Stamatis Tsantanis, the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated:\u201cAs mentioned in our recent releases, the first half of 2020 was one of the most challenging periods in the history of dry bulk shipping. Our results for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 were materially affected by the depressed earnings environment due to a combination of events that impacted negatively the Capesize market. In the beginning of the year, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Asia and the subsequent slowdown of Chinese industrial production had a detrimental effect on the demand for iron ore imports. Going into the second quarter and while the Chinese economy started to recover, the severe weather effects in Brazil handicapped Vale\u2019s iron ore production capacity. As a result, exports reduced by 10% year-over-year, and consequently, the daily TCE of the Baltic Capesize Index (\u2018BCI\u2019), on May 14, 2020 reached $1,992, the lowest point after the all-time lows in 2016.During this challenging period, we acted to enhance our liquidity and further strengthen our balance sheet by raising equity from our shareholders to reduce our debt levels and capitalize on market opportunities. In May 2020, we successfully completed a series of equity capital raising transactions, with total net proceeds of approximately $47 million.Furthermore, we concluded the refinancing of one of our loan facilities, which was maturing in July 2020, by settling the $29.1 million outstanding for $23.5 million instead. This settlement is expected to result in a $5.6 million gain and an equivalent equity accretion that will be recorded in our financial results for the third quarter of 2020. At the same time, we are making good progress in our discussions with our lenders regarding the remaining loan facilities expiring in 2020 with the objective of extending the maturities and improving the financing terms of these loan facilities.In addition, among the accretive transactions that we concluded in this period, we acquired one Capesize vessel at a historically low price, utilizing part of the equity capital raising proceeds. The vessel will be delivered to us imminently. Based on the Capesize forward freight contracts for the remainder of 2020 trading at about $20,474 per day, the incremental TCE revenue from this vessel alone may exceed $2.9 million by the end of the year.\u00a0While the effect of the above transactions will be fully reflected in our September 30, 2020 results, the current picture represents a significant improvement, with cash reserves of $30.4 million compared to $14.6 million as of December 31, 2019, and stockholders\u2019 equity of $58 million, which stands at the highest levels recorded since the Company\u2019s re-launching in 2015.Regarding current market conditions, we are very pleased to see a significant reversal of the negative factors of the first half into a full-blown recovery. Following the improvement in the weather conditions in Brazil, Vale has ramped up its production, which in combination with the robust demand for cargo from China, has seen the daily TCE of the BCI surging from its May lows of $1,992 to a 10-month high of $33,760 in July.Our daily TCE for the third quarter, based on 88% of our available days, stands at $22,414, which is 221% higher than our 1H TCE.Looking ahead, we are confident that the stable demand from China, the COVID-19 economic stimulus relief and the ramp up of the Brazilian exports, in-line with Vale\u2019s recently reiterated production guidance, will contribute towards what we believe will be a sustainably healthy market for the rest of 2020 and in 2021.Seanergy was well positioned to capture the upturn, based on index-linked employment for the majority of our fleet. In addition, we will continue to pursue opportunities that will serve our strategic targets of sustainable growth and capital structure improvement in the near future.\u201dCompany Fleet:Vessel NameVessel Size   ClassCapacity   (DWT)Year BuiltYardScrubber   Fitted Employment TypeMinimum T/C   duration  PartnershipCapesize179,2132012HyundaiYesT/C Index Linked (1)3 years  Championship (2)Capesize179,2382011SungdongYesT/C Index Linked (3)5 years  LordshipCapesize178,8382010HyundaiYesT/C Index Linked (4)3 years  PremiershipCapesize170,0242010SungdongYesT/C Index Linked (5)3 years  SquireshipCapesize170,0182010SungdongYesT/C Index Linked (6)3 years  Knightship (7)Capesize178,9782010HyundaiYesT/C Index Linked (8)3 years  GloriushipCapesize171,3142004HyundaiNoT/C Index Linked (9)10 months  FellowshipCapesize179,7012010DaewooNoVoyage/Spot\u00a0  GeniushipCapesize170,0582010SungdongNoVoyage/Spot\u00a0  LeadershipCapesize171,1992001Koyo \u2013 ImabariNoVoyage/Spot\u00a0  Goodship (10)Capesize177,5362005Mitsui EngineeringNoVoyage/Spot\u00a0      (1)Chartered by a major European utility and energy company and delivered to the charterer on September 11, 2019 for a period of minimum 33 to maximum 37 months with an optional period of 11-13 months.

Ownership days are an indicator of the size of the Company\u2019s fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that the Company recorded during a period.  \u00a0\u00a0  (2)Available days are the number of ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to major repairs, dry-dockings, lay-up or special or intermediate surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels are available to generate revenues.  \u00a0\u00a0  (3)Operating days are the number of ownership days in a period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including dry-dockings, special and intermediate surveys, lay-up days and unforeseen circumstances. Operating days also includes the days that our vessels are in ballast voyages without having finalized agreements for their next employment.  \u00a0\u00a0  (4)Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that the vessels are generating revenue and is determined by dividing operating days by ownership days for the relevant period.  \u00a0\u00a0  (5)TCE rate is defined as the Company\u2019s net revenue less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of the Company\u2019s operating days during the period. Voyage expenses include port charges, bunker (fuel oil and diesel oil) expenses, canal charges and other commissions. The Company includes the TCE rate, a non-GAAP measure, as it believes it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with net revenues from vessels, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, and because it assists the Company\u2019s management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of the Company\u2019s vessels and in evaluating their financial performance.\u00a0The Company\u2019s calculation of TCE rate may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.

The daily hire of the T/C is based on the 5 T/C routes of the BCI. In addition to the daily hire, the Company is entitled to receive revenue under a profit-sharing agreement which is triggered above a certain spread between the price of High and Low Sulphur Fuel Oil throughout the term of the charter. The charterer has compensated Seanergy for 100% of the scrubber investment, including equipment and installation cost as well as for the associated off-hire days.Public offering and Registered direct offeringsBetween April 1, 2020 and May 7, 2020, Seanergy undertook a series of equity raisings beginning with an underwritten public offering and followed by four registered direct offerings of common shares and concurrent private placements of warrants majority of which was exercised within the second quarter of the year. The aggregate gross proceeds from the offerings and the subsequent warrant exercises amounted to $51 million.Capesize vessel acquisition with prompt deliveryIn May 2020, the Company agreed to acquire a Japanese 2005-built Capesize vessel from an unaffiliated third party, for a gross purchase price of $11.4 million. The vessel will be renamed M/V Goodship and shall be delivered to the Company within August. Following delivery of the new vessel, the size of the Company\u2019s fleet will increase to 11 Capesize vessels with an aggregate cargo capacity of approximately 1,926,117 dwt. The Company will fund the gross purchase price of $11.4 million with cash on hand, as sourced through its equity capital raisings activities discussed above.Settlement agreement with a lender resulting in a gain of $5.6 MillionIn June 2020, Seanergy entered into a settlement agreement with one of its lenders concerning the facility secured by two of the Company\u2019s Capesize vessels, M/V Gloriuship and M/V Geniuship.

Top Reactions P Peter 08-03-2020 Starbucks has the concept of \"Third place\" where you spend most of your time (Home, Work... Starbucks) The \"social meetup place\" is the only real attraction of SHAK - a place to spend some time with friends or coworkers outside of work or home - somewhat like TGI Fridays, Dave & Busters etc. - it's clearly not their \"better burger\" (aka \"better marketing\") or wine menu. The concept of built-in \"CAPTIVE AUDIENCE TRAFFIC\" (i.e., mall or airport customers) was already obviously failing even before COVID, virus just made it only so more obvious. SHAK will get neither sales nor margins (already thin as they were) anywhere near \"social\" dine-in / \"Third place\" with their \"digital\" transformation even if they had a drive-through at every one of their locations. Their phony \"ADJUSTED PROFITS\" while having a negative cash flow were the result of cooking \"better books\", not \"better burgers\" and analysts turning blind eye. NYC / NY / NJ and NorthEast region have the Shacks with the highest AUV, outside of stadiums and terminals. Those are the areas that are hit the most: === On July 9, Manhattan's uber-swanky party venue Gotham Hall hosted its first event since the pandemic hit in March. The ballroom, where Elton John and Mariah Carey have performed for private events, had donated the sumptuous space \u2014 complete with marble floors, 70-foot ceilings and stained-glass skylight \u2014 to the New York Blood Center for a blood drive. ONLY 17 PEOPLE SHOWED UP. The measly turnout, industry sources say, reflects the gloomy outlook facing iconic Big Apple PARTY SPACES \u2014 from Gotham Hall to the Rainbow Room to the Plaza Hotel \u2014 as the coronavirus pandemic wears on. === === In 2008, the canary in the coal mine was declining residential real estate prices that failed to catch the attention of most market participants before it was too late because of a number of factors, including Fed easing. (Sound familiar?) Now a SIMILAR TUMULT IS BEGINNING TO INFECT THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET. DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS ARE RISING ON THE MORTGAGES OF MALLS, HIGH RISES AND OFFICE BUILDINGS, traders in this market tell me. (IOW, the available \"whitespace\" is actually shrinking, and wouldn't be getting any cheaper.) It's easy to see why: In New York City, millions of UPPER-INCOME NEW YORKERS ARE FLEEING THE CITY not just because of the pandemic but rising disorder. And who wants to shop in a mall when you need to get your temperature checked every time you walk into a store? IT'S NOT JUST A NEW YORK PHENOMENON. DOES ANYONE REALLY WANT TO WORK OR SHOP IN DOWNTOWN PORTLAND, SEATTLE, OR SAN FRANCISCO ANY TIME SOON? The underpinnings of the commercial real estate market \u2014 an estimated $16 trillion business \u2014 have BEGUN TO TURN SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE, posing an enormous systemic risk to the US economy. You won't hear any of that from the INDUSTRY'S CHEERLEADERS, WHO ARE PAID TO FOLLOW THE MANTRA that the business will bounce back when the pandemic recedes, that people will slowly return to work in high-density cities and will continue to attract the world's best and brightest once cultural activities are reopened and the cities can return to normal. All of which may be true in the long run... The only way to tell what's happening in the NEAR TERM \u2014 WHICH COULD LAST YEARS \u2014 is to look at what's happening in commercial real estate securities. Their prices are declining, a reflection of real trouble to come. === Of course, for the institutional sell-side analysts this only means that SHAK will burn through their cash faster, which will make them dilute and/or get a loan faster, making both the WS Mafia and some insiders happy. \"Analysts consensus\" (i.e., average) Consensus for Shake Shack 2020, and 2021 Earnings Lowered but Q3 Earnings Increased: \"Shake Shack Inc's (NYSE:SHAK) earnings targets for Q3 ending September 30, 2020, and the full year forecasts for 2020 and 2021 have been ADJUSTED. The Q3 earnings estimate has been increased to $-0.12 per share up from the previous consensus estimate of $-0.37 per share, while the estimate for 2020 has been lowered to $-0.56 per share from the previous consensus of $-0.48 per share and the full year 2021 estimate has also been decreased from $0.25 per share to $0.18 per share. This consensus estimate is based on 19 estimates.\" See, analysts can see that this quarter will have a significant \"improvement\" comparing to low point of Q2. More Reply Replies (1) 2 H Half Look at Shake Shack's website ... on their main page they have a photo of a smiling woman placing an order @ a Shake Shack drive-thru window.   The problem with the photo is Shake Shack has NO drive-thru windows at ANY of their restaurants. This is from a Reuters article published today: \"Industry bellwether McDonald\u2019s on Tuesday said that drive-thru accounted for nearly 90% of its quarterly sales, while urban-centric Shake Shack has only started the design process for its first ever drive-thru location, planned to open in 2021.\" More Reply Replies (3) 9 S Samson $OPES conversation Next $40 stock here... comparable to $SHAK but more locations, revenue, future goals!!! Bullish Reply 2 P Peter 2020Q2 ER just reeks of dishonesty-steeped desperation: \"During the second quarter total DIGITAL sales represented 75% of total Shack sales and MORE THAN DOUBLED COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. The Company's native web and app channels MORE THAN TRIPLED COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, and when combined, continued to be the FASTEST GROWING CHANNELS throughout Q2 and into July.\" WOW! \"More than doubled and tripled\"! Fastest GROWING CHANNELS! - what other \"growing channels\" were there? People ordering for pickup using app or web is news? Considering overall sales are down by more than a third from last year, and everybody pretty much has to preorder pickups / delivery or schedule an appointment, the base for this x2 / x3 claim was pretty small (worked for CMG, so might as well give SOMETHING FOR SELL-SIDE ANALYSTS TO BE \"CHEERFUL\" ABOUT. \"... Company has welcomed over 800,000 FIRST TIME PURCHASERS VIA ITS OWN DIGITAL CHANNELS since early March, which is NEARLY FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. The Company expects digital channels to remain a significant component of SALES AND ONGOING GROWTH.\" WOW, x4! They know it's the same people who used to just walk in without having to \"call ahead\", so... If you can't sell burgers, sell the marketing-induced \"excitement\". \"SELL THE SIZZLE, NOT THE STEAK!\" If this is so great, then why were sales down 49% with traffic down 60% - apparently \"digital\" doesn't nearly offset foot traffic, even with artificially inflated ticket price - added delivery charge, and people are more likely to order multiple items rather than a single burger in takeout. \"experienced steady increases from $32,000 in fiscal April 2020, ... representing an increase of 2.3 times THE LOW POIN tof the COVID-19 outbreak.\" - kinda desperate to compare with the \"lowest point\" to show improvement / \"GROWTH\"? \"... significant inflation in beef prices, INCREASED PAPER AND PACKAGING COSTS, a number of incremental payroll costs and HIGHER DELIVERY COMMISSIONS.\" - inflation in beef prices may have been temporary due to COVID-19, but as discussed many times before, with \"significant GROWTH\" (from zero / small initial number) of \"digital\" sales PARTIALLY REPLACING (not ADDING TO) what used to be walk-in traffic, these expenses (>1.5% increase in 20Q2) are permanent and will grow higher, wiping out most of SHAK's ALREADY SLIM OPERATING AND NET MARGINS, some of the lowest in the industry. Increased technology expense on \"digital\" is also permanent, which they glossed over. G&A percentage have increased sharply relative to smaller revenue. \"Given the SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY and blah-blah-blah, the Company has withdrawn its guidance for the fiscal year ending December 30, 2020.\" For 6 mos YoY (to capture 3 mos \"normal\" pre-COVID data): Labor and related expenses : +3.9% \"Other\" operating expenses : +2.4% Occupancy and related : +2.7% Overall sales and average ticket results are probably also inflated by delivery charges, and even worse accounting for the fact that for all or part of the Q2 the SHAKs had no rental expenses due to forbearance which will be due probably next two to four quarters. What is clear is that drive-thrus and \"digital\" are not going to sell enough high-margin dine-in \"SOCIAL\" or \"TOURIST\"-y items like alcohol or sides/shakes that attracted people to Shacks to begin with. Additional costs of food delivery for both restaurants and end-users / customers will reduce that option as well in the age of reduced DISCRETIONARY income and spending, with many former customers either unemployed, underemployed or WFH with a cut in pay and higher related expenses. One of the largest grossing Shacks at LAX now seems permanently closed, but Shacks are pretty dense in that area (like they do in many other places) so they are still cannibalizing each other since \"digital\" doesn't care much about distance, give or take a few miles. One issue that is glossed over is that as more Shacks are added to the \"comparable base\" of 24 months in operation, THE FASTER THEIR LOWER SSS and AUV IS GOING TO BE REVEALED. They may experiment and built some smaller / cheaper Shack units now, to keep the pace of unit count up (i.e., \"GROWTH\") but their total AUV would be severely affected. The income on a pile of cash received in exchange for 10% stock dilution in Q2 is currently minuscule due to ST interest rates. At the end of the Q2 (June 24 2020) they've $191M in cash+equivalents and increased ST liabilities, which means THEY WERE DELAYING THEIR PAYABLES and have a high DSO, just to show less of a CASH BURN on \"healthy balance sheet.\" That's a typical Enron-type accounting gimmick of a company that has trouble to keep appearance of high rates of revenue growth that doesn't have much else to boast about, except repeating \"opportunity for GROWTH\" mantra as an excuse for their sell-side analysts friends to put in their reports and come up with high PTs (\"due to higher than peers' GROWTH\").

If they expect more business from SHAK COB and founder Danny Meyer who is sitting on several food-related companies boards which might issue IPO or debt or otherwise raise money, that's the money strait to WS pockets as well. At the current rate of SHAK cash burn SHAK can build about 75-80 more units before they will start running out of operating capital and they will need WS to raise money again, like they did in April (via debt and deep discount dilution) so it's in WS investment banks interest for SHAK to burn cash as fast as possible for as long as possible, so they need to keep the price (and Price Targets) as high as possible for insiders and management to cash in all those bonuses and options. That's a \"WS Laundromat\" - WS Ponzi scheme, where new shareholders money keep flowing to insiders and Wall Street investment banks.

In both that release and this one they headlined it as if what followed was good news when in reality it was quite bleak and short of expectations they had set earlier. Now they are claiming improvement without giving any guidance. They will check at the end of the Q if they make estimates and if not they will repeat the process.

More Reply 2 P Peter 07-23-2020 WS sell-side analysts' game of \"expectations\" - lower them enough before earnings, which is done routinely... and 65% - 85% will \"beat\" the \"consensus estimates\" and then stock usually goes up regardless of sane valuations because the \"expected\" earnings and revenues were \"priced in\" (another meaningless but ubiquitous WS phrase.) CMG earnings has shown that margins on \"digital + pick-up\" orders were down by about 50% (despite complaints that the orders themselves were smaller in size than buying in-store). \"Digital + delivery\" added about 25% to average orders so that can't last long, especially with many now being semi-permanently laid-off / unemployed or WFH with cut in pay and additional work-related expenses - and that's with very generous unemployment benefits that are about to expire or be cut substantially while gov't keep borrowing and printing $Trillion$ of green stuff. === 07-22-2020 One thing Tesla does have going for it is a constellation of COMMENTATORS WILLING TO SING ITS PRAISES TO INFINITY AND BEYOND, though their convictions can appear shallow.

A third of the city's 230,000 small business may never reopen, according to a grim new report by The Partnership for New York City. Most small businesses have less than three months worth of cash reserves. \"That means that funds to restart, PAY BACK RENT and buy inventory are exhausted, leaving tens of thousands of entrepreneurs at risk. Business owners face HIGH RENTS, REGULATORY BURDENS and TAXES.\" \"COVID-19 has changed the value proposition, since PREVIOUS ADVANTAGES SUCH AS FOOT TRAFFIC AND EASY ACCESS TO THE OFFICES OF CLIENTS AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS HAVE DIMINISHED. On the contrary, over the past decade, political forces have created a much more expensive and litigious environment for business that is no longer sustainable for those whose margins were narrow before the pandemic,\" report said. City has 18 percent unemployment rate, although there's a shortage of skilled workers in areas like accounting and business development. 54 percent of city jobs CAN BE DONE REMOTELY with some NYC companies no longer requiring new hires to live in state. Raising taxes for the wealthy could push the city's highest earners \u2014 who account for 40 percent of the state's tax revenue \u2014 to move elsewhere. === --- === 07-20-2020 Mortgage payments may be a challenge as $600 unemployment bump nears expiration. More than half of mortgage borrowers experienced INCOME LOSS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. Forty percent of mortgage borrowers said either themselves or someone in their household has been receiving unemployment benefits. The $600 unemployment bump has helped buoy many households' financial situations throughout the pandemic. In fact, studies have shown BENEFITS FOR 68 PERCENT OF WORKERS WOULD EXCEED EARNINGS. However, facing income loss, Americans said they would be most willing to default on their mortgage payments as a means to make ends meet than other debt payments. Meanwhile, millions of Americans continue to file NEW UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS each week. \"To avoid a SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CONSUMER SPENDING once the $600 bonus expires, either the economy will have to create a lot of jobs very quickly or we need more fiscal support.\" Unless the government intends to spend several hundred billion dollars to further support personal income, the ability for people out of work to support themselves has disappeared for millions of workers. There is an illusion that an 11% unemployment rate is a victory after the 14.7% one in April. The fact is that 10% unemployment was the worst monthly level of the Great Recession. The economy was in horrible shape even when the number was 8%. So, if the current level remains over 8%, the economy is in a shambles. The END OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IS NOT THE WORST PROBLEM. If confirmed COVID-19 cases continue to rise by as much as 70,000 a day, the crisis will shutter much of the economy for a second time. Some epidemiologists believe another wave of cases will start in October. It will be, by many accounts, worse than the first one, given a widespread and often undetected COVID-19 infected population throughout the country. The stock markets cannot rise much more under these levels of pressure. The pullback in the early part of this year took the Dow Jones industrial average from 28,000 to 19,000 in a matter of weeks. If Apple, Amazon, Alphabet / Google, Facebook and Microsoft had not held their ground, compared to the market as a whole, the drop would have been much worse. === $SHAK $GRUB $UBER More Reply Replies (3) 16 1 D Darice Shake Shack's same-store-sales were absolutely pitiful compared to their competitors ...

New York City's progress fighting the coronavirus is doing little to help retailers, who say business in the city has become worse than anywhere else in the country. National retailers \u2014 from SHAKE SHACK, APPLEBEES, and cap seller Lids \u2014 say their Big Apple stores are BOUNCING BACK SLOWER THAN EVEN NEIGHBORING STATES like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which were also hard hit by the coronavirus. The problem, sources say, is Manhattan, which used to be teeming with TOURISTS AND COMMUTERS who have largely stayed away since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March. Wealthy Manhattanites also have more resources and flexibility to escape, indefinitely, to greener pastures, like the Hamptons, experts say. The city's GHOST-TOWN VIBE has SHAKE SHACK, which runs 162 restaurants in 20 states, reporting that its Big Apple stores will \"TAKE A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO FULLY RECOVER than other parts of the country.\" The burger chain made the statement on July 7 as it reported that NYC SAME-STORE SALES for the week of July 1 had fallen 58 percent compared to a year earlier \u2014 the steepest decline among all its regions. Sales in the chain's Northeast and Southeast stores, by contrast, fell just 24 percent and 32 percent, respectively. While Shake Shack didn't mention Manhattan specifically, Zane Tankel, who owns 35 Applebee's in the NY-metro area, told The Post that he's reopened 18 restaurants in neighboring regions, including Brooklyn and Queens. But he SEES NO POINT IN REOPENING HIS TWO MANHATTAN STORES \u2014 NOT EVEN FOR CURBSIDE PICKUP. \"I drive around the city all the time and it was an easy determination to see that there's not enough traffic to open those restaurants,\" said Tankel, CEO of Apple Metro. Prior to the pandemic, the Manhattan Applebee's were his most productive locations \u2014 representing $25 million in revenues. === --- Needless to say, SHAK's NYC units have had the highest AUVs and the highest leases / sqft. #SHAK $DIN More Reply 7 1 D David Chipotle ($CMG) just reported same-store-sales for the 2nd Quarter of - 9.8%.

More Reply 7 P Peter === 07-16-2020 Americans Tear Up Old Eating Habits. Almost a THIRD OF ADULTS PLAN TO COOK AT HOME MORE post-Covid. RESTAURANT PULLBACK could rebalance the food supply chain. Americans have rapidly changed the ways they buy, cook and eat food in just four months, leaving everyone from farmers to restaurants unable to match their pivot. U.S. consumers, whose previous food preferences were stable enough that farmers could often make reliable planting decisions years in advance, have shifted their habits at fast pace during the coronavirus pandemic. That includes COOKING MORE AT HOME, purchasing in bulk, FORGOING BRAND-NAME TREATS and eating SMALLER MEALS due to FEWER TRIPS TO RESTAURANTS with their often oversized portions. Even one of those changes by itself could throw a wrench in the global food supply chain. ADD ALL FIVE TOGETHER, and some suppliers are finding they can't adapt fast enough to keep pace with all the changing consumer demands. Farmers, like a lettuce grower in California, have been forced to destroy crops after restaurant demand dried up. The ways Americans are changing their food habits are not only MULTIPLE AND SIGNIFICANT \u2014 they're also POTENTIALLY PERMANENT. Almost a THIRD OF U.S. ADULTS SAY THEY PLAN TO COOK AT HOME EVEN MORE THAN THEY DO NOW, ONCE STAY-AT-HOME RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE LIFTED. Home-kitchen purchases back that up: In the early weeks of the pandemic, U.S. sales of electric pasta makers grew more than five times what they were a year prior. Breadmaker sales more than quadrupled. More than a quarter of adults purchased items in bulk more often. BRANDS have also fallen out of favor, as 23% of respondents said they purchased GENERIC or store brands more often. In fact, 16% of Americans plan to buy private-label or bulk items even more frequently once the pandemic ends. As consumers cook more at home, driving up grocery store sales, they're STEERING CLEAR OF RESTAURANTS. === $SHAK $GRUB $UBER More Reply 10 2 P Peter @Mike Arena ... <->chitpole up at all time highs on take out orders why would shake shack be any different <-> Because they're entirely different companies with different customers profile, financials, margins / profitability, number and quality of competitors, business strategy, growth strategy etc. Also because SHAK has been priced at more than double of CMG for a long while, while their SSS has been shrinking and their space has been more expensive while utilized less than most of even their much larger burger market peers that are valued at a fraction of SHAK market cap. Also, the kind of Tex-Mex food Chipotle serves is much more popular and has far less competition than the burger and chicken space: TOP FOODS OF 2020 TO DATE In 2019 we were introduced to the CHICKEN SANDWICH WAR, and in 2020 it raged on as chain and independent restaurants added the sandwich to their menus for diners to enjoy.

Reply Replies (2) P Peter Reading a little deeper into \"sneaky\"-worded preliminary release, things in rearview mirror are bigger and worse than they appear: 1. That cash burn IMPROVED to $200K / wk only because it was \"ADJUSTED\" (just like all their P&L / income statements numbers) - \"cash burn has improved to approximately $200,000 per week EXCLUDING the temporary premium pay increase for shack teams and new Shack capital expenditure.\" (yes, folks, we'll be here all week - in reality, SHAK has burned more than $6M just in May and June, and that's not even spending any money on already prepaid openings of 4 units.) 2. \"Same-Shack sales\" represents Shack sales for the comparable Shack base... For days that Shacks were TEMPORARILY CLOSED, the comparative 2019 period was also ADJUSTED. (IOW, the numbers and percentages have been prorated / \"ADJUSTED,\" not including the total loss for \"dark\" period.) 3. \"Average weekly sales\" is calculated by dividing total Shack sales by the number of operating weeks for all Shacks...  For Shacks that are not open for the entire period, fractional ADJUSTMENTS are made to the number of operating weeks. (See comment above.) === 07-08-2020 As Businesses Reopen, Many Americans Plan to Spend Less More than 40% of adults say they'll cut back on some of the very DISCRETIONARY SPENDING needed by struggling retailers. More than 40% of people who spent money on movies, event tickets or at bars before the pandemic now plan to spend LESS on those activities. Thirty percent of Americans who used to spend at the movies and on sports, concerts and theater tickets said they'll be spending MUCH LESS going forward and many said they'll slash spending at bars (28%), dining out (21%) and gyms (20%). The planned cutbacks may compound the already massive economic impact of the virus. As cases spiked this spring, states shut down or restricted may businesses, such as SALONS AND RESTAURANTS. Sports leagues postponed their seasons and concerts were cancelled. The unemployment rate remains above 10% and MANY OF THE VIRUS-RELATED LAYOFFS THAT ONCE APPEARED TEMPORARY ARE BECOMING PERMANENT. The pandemic may have long term effects on spending habits. While business owners have found creative ways to bring in money during the shutdowns, HALF OF AMERICANS AREN'T LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING BACK TO A BAR, AND MORE THAN ONE-THIRD AREN'T EXCITED ABOUT HEADING OUT TO A SPORTS GAME, MOVIE OR LIVE EVENT. Americans may have also LEARNED TO LIVE WITHOUT SOME OF THESE EXPENSES over the past few months. Instead of paying for a gym membership, for example, they may now be satisfied with working out at home or a local park. Consumers seem aware of the impact their spending can have on struggling businesses and employees. When they do spend money, 59% of respondents said they were tipping more or GOING TO LOCAL BUSINESSES MORE THAN USUAL. === --- On our sell-side analysts front: \"Cowen analyst Andrew Charles weighs on MARKET-PERFORM RATED Shake Shack: Charles says he is ENCOURAGED BY COMMENTARY of resuming store development, improving weekly cash burn rate and the repayment of short-term debt.

I think it normally takes 45 days from the start of the first day post bk filing, it will continue to trade.

Here\u2019s Why. The Chinese tech and entertainment giant has more than a one-third stake in both platforms, Huya and DouYu International Holdings. Bloomberg Tencent in Talks to Create $10 Billion Streaming Giant (Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. is driving discussions to merge China\u2019s biggest game-streaming platforms Huya Inc. and DouYu International Holdings Ltd., people familiar with the matter said, in a deal that would allow it to dominate the $3.4 billion arena.The Chinese social media titan -- which owns a 37% stake in Huya and 38% of DouYu -- has been discussing such a merger with the duo over the past few months, although details have yet to be finalized, said the people, who asked not to be identified because discussions are private. Tencent is seeking to become the largest shareholder in the combined entity, one person said.A deal would create an online giant with more than 300 million users and a combined market value of $10 billion, cementing Tencent\u2019s lead in Chinese games and social media. Faced with rising competition for advertisers from ByteDance Ltd. and its rapidly growing stable of apps, the WeChat operator would then run a highly profitable service akin to Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Twitch. Huya and DouYu would keep their respective platforms and branding while working more closely with Tencent\u2019s own esports site eGame, said the people.Douyu\u2019s shares surged 18% in pre-market trade in New York, while Huya soared 15%. Tencent climbed 2% to a two-week high in Hong Kong.\u201cAs the major shareholder of both platforms, Tencent would benefit because a merger would remove unnecessary competition between them,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. \u201cThe enlarged scale can also help to drive cost synergies and fend off emerging competitors.\u201dTencent and DouYu representatives declined to comment, while Huya spokespeople didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Tencent\u2019s shoring up its home-market position against the backdrop of a Trump administration increasingly hostile toward Chinese tech companies. WeChat has a limited U.S. presence and Trovo Live, a mobile-focused game-streaming service for American consumers, is only in its initial stages.China\u2019s game-streaming market is estimated to generate 23.6 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) in revenue this year, according to iResearch. The country\u2019s streaming networks live and die by the popularity of star players and the virtual tips and gifts that fans buy for them, leading to intense bidding wars for the most-recognized names. Companies like Google-backed Chushou TV shuttered their services after failing to secure new money, while NetEase Inc.\u2019s CC Live has found a small niche in broadcasting its in-house titles.Already featuring Tencent\u2019s marquee games like PUBG Mobile and Honor of Kings, Huya and DouYu have established a clear lead as the top two platforms. Nevertheless, revenue growth slowed down for both in recent quarters as users shifted their attention to ByteDance\u2019s Douyin, the Chinese twin to the globally popular TikTok short-video service. A merger would help them lower broadcast and content costs at a time when rival video services like Kuaishou and Bilibili Inc -- both also backed by Tencent -- intensify their efforts to compete for more gaming content.In April, Tencent bought an additional stake in Huya for about $260 million from Joyy Inc., boosting its voting power in the platform to more than 50%. When asked about the possibility of a merger with Huya, DouYu founder and Chief Executive Officer Chen Shaojie told analysts on a March earnings call: \u201cWe believe it\u2019s Tencent\u2019s vision.\u201d(Updates with share action from the fourth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Today, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin jolted them awake.Wall Street was already bracing for record-sized\u00a0debt sales from the U.S. Treasury, given the\u00a0federal government\u2019s rapid increase in spending to combat\u00a0the coronavirus crisis. But what almost no one saw coming was Mnuchin\u2019s willingness to aggressively ramp up sales of the longest-dated securities. The department announced Wednesday that starting in August,\u00a0it would increase 10-year note auctions by $6 billion, the just-implemented 20-year bond auctions by $5 billion and 30-year bond auctions by $4 billion.In total, the Treasury will issue\u00a0$108 billion of 10-year notes, $69 billion of 20-year bonds and $72 billion of 30-year bonds over the next three months.\u00a0Of the 22 primary dealers that Bloomberg News\u2019s\u00a0Elizabeth Stanton surveyed, 21 of them forecast\u00a0smaller boosts to those maturities. Only Morgan Stanley got it right.\u00a0The department, which had previously leaned heavily on short-term bills to offset the sudden surge in government spending, said\u00a0it plans to use \u201clong-term issuance as a prudent means of managing its maturity profile and limiting potential future issuance volatility.\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s probably true, but it\u2019s also likely not the whole story.Lately, the $20 trillion U.S. Treasury market has been in a slumber, with a gauge of bond volatility falling to an all-time low on July 30. After Powell reiterated last week that he and his fellow policy makers \u201care not even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising rates,\u201d the benchmark 10-year yield reached the lowest in more than two centuries, per research from Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank AG. All this led\u00a0DoubleLine Capital\u2019s Jeffrey Gundlach to tweet on Monday that there were \u201cmany layers of meaning\u201d in the world\u2019s biggest bond market being brought to heel.It\u2019s important to view the Treasury\u2019s latest announcement through the lens of its unprecedented coordination with the Fed throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, as evidenced by the central bank\u2019s vast array of new lending programs. The Fed, of course, only directly influences short-term interest rates through its main policy rate and forward guidance. It can have a more indirect impact on longer-term yields through the composition of its Treasury purchases, which currently run at about $80 billion a month.It stands to reason that for the sake of the financial system, the Fed would prefer a U.S. yield curve that\u2019s a bit steeper than it is right now. The difference between five- and 30-year Treasuries is 101 basis points, compared with about 191 basis points in July 2012 when the five-year yield set its previous record low. The spread exceeded 300 basis points in late 2010. To nudge the curve higher,\u00a0the Fed could just stop buying long-term debt, but given the market\u2019s breakdown in March\u00a0and the shaky economic recovery,\u00a0it\u2019s understandably loath\u00a0to signal any sort of tapering.So if the Fed can\u2019t buy less, then the Treasury can just issue more. It achieves the same goal.\u00a0\u201cThe U.S. Treasury was aggressive yet again in growing coupon issuance,\u201d Jon Hill, vice president of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note after the announcement.\u00a0\u201cThe latest auction performance has clearly increased confidence inside the U.S. Treasury that sharp increases in auction sizes will be met with strong demand.\u201d Jim Vogel at FHN Financial said the department moved \u201cfrom baby steps to giant in coupon auction sizes\u201d relative to the previous quarter.The Fed, by contrast, has done the opposite. Its balance sheet grew by almost $3 trillion from March through June, but has since held steady around $7 trillion for several weeks. Financial markets are humming again, and Powell seems content to move slowly on rolling out additional easing measures like yield-curve control and enhanced forward guidance, particularly given that traders are already acting as if those policies are in place.Supply alone will only go so far \u2014\u00a0in fact, the yield curve steepened to an almost two-week high on Wednesday, but then quickly pared that move. Ultimately, even tens of billions of dollars in additional debt is\u00a0just a drop in the bucket. Still, the policy actions in the past week\u00a0indicate\u00a0that\u00a0Powell and Mnuchin are both eyeing\u00a0the Treasury market and will use their tools to push it and pull it until interest rates are where they want them.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Brian Chappatta is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering debt markets.

TREASURIES-U.S. plan to issue more long-dated debt steepens yield curve Reuters U.S. Treasury to continue shift to longer-dated debt Reuters Bloomberg ADP\u2019s U.S. Job Data Misses Estimates, Signaling New Virus Drag (Bloomberg) -- Payroll gains at U.S. companies slowed sharply in July, suggesting the pickup in coronavirus cases is putting the brakes on the job market and the economic recovery.The 167,000 in business payrolls last month followed an upwardly revised 4.31 million increase in June, according to ADP Research Institute data released Wednesday. The July increase trailed all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists which had a median projection of 1.2 million. June payrolls were previously reported as rising 2.4 million.The sharp slowdown in the pace of payroll gains is consistent with other data that show the labor market in danger of regressing after rebounding in the months immediately following the lifting of state lockdowns on businesses. Applications for unemployment benefits have risen for two straight weeks amid a spike in Covid-19 cases that has forced some rollbacks in reopening plans.The ADP data precede the government\u2019s jobs report on Friday, which is forecast to show private payrolls increased by 1.5 million in July after a 4.8 million gain a month earlier. At the same time, the initial ADP figures for May and June were significantly below the Labor Department\u2019s official tallies.\u201cWe have seen the slowdown impact businesses across all sizes and sectors,\u201d Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute, said in a statement.Stocks climbed for a fourth day. A separate report showed U.S. service industries expanded in July at the fastest pace since February 2019 as the strongest reading yet on orders and a pickup in business activity more than offset a bigger contraction in employment.ADP said service-provider employment rose by 166,000, while payrolls at goods producers increased 1,000 in July. Employment in the leisure and hospitality industry, which had gained more than 3 million in the prior two months, rose just 38,000 in July.Other recent job-market indicators \u201chave sort of flat-lined over the past month, and that told us that there\u2019s probably some slowing in the labor recovery,\u201d said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.The ADP report showed payrolls at small businesses increased by 63,000 last month, while medium-size businesses shed 25,000 jobs. Payrolls climbed 129,000 at large firms.ADP\u2019s payroll data represent firms employing nearly 26 million workers in the U.S.(Updates with services industry report in sixth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. US sees deep private hiring slump ahead of jobs data AFP Private Payrolls Slow Down in July Zacks Bloomberg Britain's Struggling Banks Show the U.K.'s Economic Weakness (Bloomberg Opinion) -- The U.K.\u2019s biggest banks have come a long way since the financial crisis, when taxpayers had to rescue them to the tune of tens of billions of pounds. They\u2019re certainly stronger, with comfortable capital buffers, as they head\u00a0into what could be the worst recession in three centuries.But with the future of the economic rebound still far from certain, they\u2019re having to set aside huge sums of cash to cover the potential loan losses. With rock-bottom interest rates squeezing profit margins, and the terms of Brexit still not finalized,\u00a0it\u2019s little wonder investors are staying clear.Shares in Britain\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d \u2014\u00a0HSBC Holdings Plc, Barclays Plc, Lloyds Banking Group Plc and the recently rebranded NatWest Group Plc \u2014\u00a0have all performed worse than their European peers this year. Lloyds and NatWest, the most exposed to the U.K. economy, have seen more than half of their market values wiped out, leaving them not far off the lows of the financial crisis.\u00a0Banco Santander SA,\u00a0which runs Britain's fifth-largest bank, last week wrote $7.2 billion off the value of its U.K. offshoot.One reason for the investor anguish is the potential hit to lenders\u2019 balance sheets from companies and households that won\u2019t be able to repay their borrowings because of the Covid lockdowns. HSBC Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson on Monday told Bloomberg Television that the U.K. is one of the weakest economies he can see globally.Analysts are expecting provisions across the four banks to total $27 billion this year, with HSBC making up more than a third of that.\u00a0For perspective, they earned slightly less than $19 billion combined last year. Banks elsewhere in Europe \u2014\u00a0big lenders to small and medium-sized companies \u2014 have been making similar writedowns, but so far the U.K. finance industry seems to be in a worse spot.When reporting second-quarter earnings last week, several U.K. lenders said the provisions reflected\u00a0a slower economic rebound and higher anticipated unemployment. State-controlled NatWest now estimates that British joblessness could top 9%. That would exceed the 8.4% rate at the peak of the financial crisis.The bankers\u2019 conservative assessments are warranted. According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank, unemployment\u00a0will rise to almost 10% later this year once the government\u2019s furlough scheme ends at the end of October.U.K. banks are especially sensitive to the jobs market because so much of their business is consumer-based. There is a high correlation between unemployment and delinquencies across unsecured lending and credit cards, for example. Mortgages are another critical business, and analysts at Deutsche Bank AG say borrowers\u2019 ability to repay is affected exponentially once unemployment rises past 8%. Deutsche estimates that losses at six U.K. lenders could reach\u00a059 billion pounds ($77 billion) over two years if joblessness hits 10%.The drop in interest rates will also hurt, denting revenue and margins, and putting more pressure on costs. Then there\u2019s Brexit. The possibility of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal features in banks\u2019 most extreme\u00a0scenario planning, but it still wouldn\u2019t be a happy event during a global pandemic.\u00a0And while there was a surge in British retail sales in June, a survey of households showed consumer confidence remained weak in July even before Britain started tightening\u00a0lockdowns again.It\u2019s a good thing capital isn\u2019t an issue \u2014\u00a0 for now. The banks expect their buffers to come under pressure, but the big four all reported an improvement in their common equity Tier 1 ratio in the second quarter, thanks in part to regulatory changes. That will help them weather the storm, but the situation is bleak.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Elisa Martinuzzi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering finance.

A person who answered the phone at the company's Hong Kong offices referred all inquiries to its Auckland office.The regulator said transactions at issue occurred between April 2015 and November 2018, and involved about NZ$50 million (US$32 million). The maximum penalty for each alleged breach is NZ$2 million, according to the FMA. DBS CEO Gupta warns of correction on market disconnect, IMF downgrade loomsThe FMA said it had filed its civil proceedings in the High Court in Auckland and was seeking monetary penalties and court costs. The court filing was not immediately available on Tuesday.CLSA Premium's majority owner is Citic Securities, which is also the parent company of brokerage and investment bank CLSA. The company is not directly affiliated with CLSA.Citic Securities paid HK$780 million (US$100.6 million) in 2015 for a majority stake in the forex trader, which was known at the time as KVB Kunlun.CLSA Premium changed its name last year, saying in a stock exchange filing at the time that the change was to \"better reflect that the group is part of the substantial shareholder's group of entities, including CLSA group\". The company said in its annual report in April that the rebranding was to \"differentiate itself from unaffiliated entities that are using a similar name and conducting a similar business\". AIA gets go-ahead to convert Shanghai branch into local subsidiaryCLSA Premium reported an annual loss of HK$180 million last year, compared with a profit of HK$34.2 million in 2018. Its revenue fell to HK$16.1 million in 2019, compared with HK$471.1 million in the prior year.The company attributed its net loss to a reduction in leveraged forex trading because of a decline in customers and reduced volatility in the currency markets last year, a tightening of rules in Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand for leveraged forex trading, and a global economic slowdown.Last year, CLSA Premium also jettisoned a number of Chinese clients who could not prove they lived outside the mainland. The company's chief executive and chief financial officer also resigned last July in a dispute with its directors.CLSA Premium's shares are lightly traded, last closing on Monday at 23 HK cents.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Bloomberg Hang Seng Index Set for Major Revamp That Paves Way for Alibaba (Bloomberg) -- The 50-year old Hang Seng Index is poised to embrace change, and it couldn\u2019t come soon enough for investors forced to put up with years of dismal underperformance.On Monday at around 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, the compiler of the gauge is expected to announce whether companies with secondary listings and unequal voting rights will be included for the first time, namely Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Doing so would open the door to transforming the Hang Seng from a gauge overstuffed with banks and insurers to one that better reflects the technological dynamism of China\u2019s economy.Alibaba -- one of China\u2019s most valuable companies -- launched a secondary listing in Hong Kong in November. Another potential candidate for inclusion is Meituan Dianping, China\u2019s largest food-delivery website, while JD.com Inc. is considering a secondary listing of its own in the city. With almost $30 billion of pension-fund assets and exchange-traded funds tracking the gauge as of December, such a change could spur a flood of local share sales by U.S.-listed firms.\u201cThe decision is going to completely change the nature of index, which has been characterized as one with low valuation and low growth rate for a long time,\u201d said Yang Lingxiu, strategist at Citic Securities Co.About half of the total weighting of the Hang Seng Index is in financial firms, compared with about 15% on average for benchmarks in Europe, the U.S., Japan and mainland China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has gained 1.7% a year on average in the past decade, versus 5.2% for the MSCI All-Country World Index. In January, the Hang Seng approached its lowest level relative to the MSCI measure since 2004.The process of adding the likes of Alibaba may take some time, however. \u201cIn order to reduce the one-off impact on the market, the index may propose adding the weight of Alibaba gradually,\u201d said Chi Man Wong, analyst at China Galaxy International Financial Holdings. Alibaba is the biggest company listed in Hong Kong by market cap and is the second most actively traded stock in the past 30 days, just after the Hang Seng Index\u2019s largest component Tencent Holdings Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The index would need to delete two companies to add Alibaba and Meituan, as current rules require the number of firms on the gauge to be fixed at 50. Component maker AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. and snack firm Want Want China Holdings Ltd. are among likely candidates for deletion due to their smaller market capitalization, according to traders.The addition would raise the Hang Seng Index\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio to about 12 from the current 11, making it more expensive than Shanghai Composite Index, data show.Ultimately, the weight of technology and consumer discretionary sectors\u2019 could surge from the current single digits to more than 30%, if all U.S.-listed Chinese companies that match the Hang Seng\u2019s requirements list in the city and are included in the index, according to Citic Securities Co.To be sure, giving greater weight to companies with unequal voting rights could raise investor concerns.\u201cThe key issue is that weighted voting rights create an opportunity for someone to have greater influence than their economic ownership would suggest,\u201d said Gabriel Wilson-Otto, head of stewardship Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \u201cThe underlying concern is that this heightens the potential for agency risk, and reduces avenues of recourse if the company does something that\u2019s not in the best interests of the minority shareholders.\u201dInvestors in some U.S-listed Chinese firms have recently been burned by accounting scandals, raising questions about the standard of corporate governance at some companies.Two Accounting Scandals in a Week Burn China Inc. Investors (1)The Hang Seng Index would nevertheless benefit from luring more U.S.-listed companies, said Cliff Zhao, head of strategy with CCB International Securities Ltd.\u201cMore funds will be attracted to follow the index, which is a good thing for Hong Kong\u2019s stock market.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Railway shares continued to perform poorly as domestic virus cases continued to rise, reflecting lack of investors' confidence in the government's campaign to promote domestic tourism that started on Wednesday.

A person who answered the phone at the company's Hong Kong offices referred all inquiries to its Auckland office.The regulator said transactions at issue occurred between April 2015 and November 2018, and involved about NZ$50 million (US$32 million). The maximum penalty for each alleged breach is NZ$2 million, according to the FMA. DBS CEO Gupta warns of correction on market disconnect, IMF downgrade loomsThe FMA said it had filed its civil proceedings in the High Court in Auckland and was seeking monetary penalties and court costs. The court filing was not immediately available on Tuesday.CLSA Premium's majority owner is Citic Securities, which is also the parent company of brokerage and investment bank CLSA. The company is not directly affiliated with CLSA.Citic Securities paid HK$780 million (US$100.6 million) in 2015 for a majority stake in the forex trader, which was known at the time as KVB Kunlun.CLSA Premium changed its name last year, saying in a stock exchange filing at the time that the change was to \"better reflect that the group is part of the substantial shareholder's group of entities, including CLSA group\". The company said in its annual report in April that the rebranding was to \"differentiate itself from unaffiliated entities that are using a similar name and conducting a similar business\". AIA gets go-ahead to convert Shanghai branch into local subsidiaryCLSA Premium reported an annual loss of HK$180 million last year, compared with a profit of HK$34.2 million in 2018. Its revenue fell to HK$16.1 million in 2019, compared with HK$471.1 million in the prior year.The company attributed its net loss to a reduction in leveraged forex trading because of a decline in customers and reduced volatility in the currency markets last year, a tightening of rules in Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand for leveraged forex trading, and a global economic slowdown.Last year, CLSA Premium also jettisoned a number of Chinese clients who could not prove they lived outside the mainland. The company's chief executive and chief financial officer also resigned last July in a dispute with its directors.CLSA Premium's shares are lightly traded, last closing on Monday at 23 HK cents.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Bloomberg Hang Seng Index Set for Major Revamp That Paves Way for Alibaba (Bloomberg) -- The 50-year old Hang Seng Index is poised to embrace change, and it couldn\u2019t come soon enough for investors forced to put up with years of dismal underperformance.On Monday at around 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, the compiler of the gauge is expected to announce whether companies with secondary listings and unequal voting rights will be included for the first time, namely Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Doing so would open the door to transforming the Hang Seng from a gauge overstuffed with banks and insurers to one that better reflects the technological dynamism of China\u2019s economy.Alibaba -- one of China\u2019s most valuable companies -- launched a secondary listing in Hong Kong in November. Another potential candidate for inclusion is Meituan Dianping, China\u2019s largest food-delivery website, while JD.com Inc. is considering a secondary listing of its own in the city. With almost $30 billion of pension-fund assets and exchange-traded funds tracking the gauge as of December, such a change could spur a flood of local share sales by U.S.-listed firms.\u201cThe decision is going to completely change the nature of index, which has been characterized as one with low valuation and low growth rate for a long time,\u201d said Yang Lingxiu, strategist at Citic Securities Co.About half of the total weighting of the Hang Seng Index is in financial firms, compared with about 15% on average for benchmarks in Europe, the U.S., Japan and mainland China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has gained 1.7% a year on average in the past decade, versus 5.2% for the MSCI All-Country World Index. In January, the Hang Seng approached its lowest level relative to the MSCI measure since 2004.The process of adding the likes of Alibaba may take some time, however. \u201cIn order to reduce the one-off impact on the market, the index may propose adding the weight of Alibaba gradually,\u201d said Chi Man Wong, analyst at China Galaxy International Financial Holdings. Alibaba is the biggest company listed in Hong Kong by market cap and is the second most actively traded stock in the past 30 days, just after the Hang Seng Index\u2019s largest component Tencent Holdings Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The index would need to delete two companies to add Alibaba and Meituan, as current rules require the number of firms on the gauge to be fixed at 50. Component maker AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. and snack firm Want Want China Holdings Ltd. are among likely candidates for deletion due to their smaller market capitalization, according to traders.The addition would raise the Hang Seng Index\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio to about 12 from the current 11, making it more expensive than Shanghai Composite Index, data show.Ultimately, the weight of technology and consumer discretionary sectors\u2019 could surge from the current single digits to more than 30%, if all U.S.-listed Chinese companies that match the Hang Seng\u2019s requirements list in the city and are included in the index, according to Citic Securities Co.To be sure, giving greater weight to companies with unequal voting rights could raise investor concerns.\u201cThe key issue is that weighted voting rights create an opportunity for someone to have greater influence than their economic ownership would suggest,\u201d said Gabriel Wilson-Otto, head of stewardship Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Asset Management. \u201cThe underlying concern is that this heightens the potential for agency risk, and reduces avenues of recourse if the company does something that\u2019s not in the best interests of the minority shareholders.\u201dInvestors in some U.S-listed Chinese firms have recently been burned by accounting scandals, raising questions about the standard of corporate governance at some companies.Two Accounting Scandals in a Week Burn China Inc. Investors (1)The Hang Seng Index would nevertheless benefit from luring more U.S.-listed companies, said Cliff Zhao, head of strategy with CCB International Securities Ltd.\u201cMore funds will be attracted to follow the index, which is a good thing for Hong Kong\u2019s stock market.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Natural gas fuel specialist Clean Energy Fuels\u00a0(NASDAQ: CLNE) has been working for years to change that.  It took on a lot of debt to build \"America's Natural Gas Highway,\" lining a coast-to-coast route with natural gas filling stations and placing more in major urban centers to make it easier for trucking companies to switch their fleets to from diesel to natural gas. Bloomberg The World\u2019s Hottest Stock Is a Money-Losing Tech Giant Soaring 880% (Bloomberg) -- It gets far less attention than Tesla, the FAANGs or even the Robinhood flavor of the week.Yet Sea Ltd. has quietly become the world\u2019s best-performing large-cap stock, stoking a debate on Wall Street over whether the Singapore-based gaming, e-commerce and payments company is the next great internet colossus or just Exhibit A in a global tech bubble that\u2019s destined to burst.For now at least, bulls have the upper hand. Swelling optimism that loss-making Sea may one day become both the Tencent and Alibaba of Southeast Asia has boosted its New York-listed shares by more than 880% in the past 18 months, the largest gain worldwide among companies with a starting market value of at least $1 billion. Short sellers who placed record wagers against the stock in June are retreating at an unprecedented pace.If Sea Chief Executive Officer Forrest Li is paying attention to any of this, he\u2019s not letting on. The 42-year-old billionaire said in a video interview that he\u2019s been working seven-day weeks in the office since April, leading his company through what may be its most pivotal year. Demand for Sea\u2019s mobile games and online-shopping platform has surged during the pandemic, and the company is bidding on a Singapore digital-banking license to accelerate its push into financial services. Li is also looking for potential acquisitions in gaming, logistics and e-commerce.\u201cWe don\u2019t like to think too much about our success or how we got here,\u201d he said when asked about Sea\u2019s stock price. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the environment is good or bad. It doesn\u2019t change a company or a person.\u201dEven by the standards of today\u2019s tech boom, Li\u2019s ascent has been remarkable. Born in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, he worked for the local units of Motorola Solutions Inc. and Corning Inc. before enrolling in Stanford\u2019s MBA program. He founded Sea, then known as Garena, in 2009 and took it public with backing from Tencent in 2017.Read more about Li, who named himself after Forrest Gump.After a rocky first year of trading, Sea\u2019s stock has gone on to trounce everything in its class. Initially, the gains were fueled by the runaway success of Sea\u2019s first self-made mobile game -- a battle royale called Free Fire that has attracted as many as 80 million daily active users in more than 130 markets.But Sea\u2019s e-commerce and financial services units are now increasingly important pillars of the bull case. Its Shopee platform overtook Alibaba\u2019s Lazada in the fourth quarter of 2019 to become the top e-commerce provider in Southeast Asia, according to research firm iPrice, and the business accounted for more than 40% of Sea\u2019s revenue in 2019, up from 2.3% in 2017.SeaMoney, which offers everything from e-wallets to micro loans, could ultimately be just as large, according to Li. \u201cWe think this is a huge business opportunity,\u201d he said.Read more: Sea\u2019s Singapore Digital Bank Bid Targets Millennials, SMEsThe soft-spoken founder has some big-name believers. Tencent still owns about 20% of Sea, and the stock was the biggest holding as of May in Noah Blackstein\u2019s Dynamic Power Global Growth Class fund, one of the world\u2019s top-performing equity mutual funds of the past decade. Other prominent shareholders include Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global Management LLC and Kora Management LP, an emerging markets-focused hedge fund in New York, according to regulatory filings as of March.Kora began investing in Sea in early 2018 after meeting with Li, Daniel Jacobs, the hedge fund\u2019s founding partner, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last two years a company that\u2019s got a great team and great products going after a big market and just executing incredibly well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is a mini Tencent and has the ability to be a really successful, large company in a global context.\u201dSea has already claimed the title of biggest company in Southeast Asia after its market value swelled to $65 billion, topping DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and PT Bank Central Asia for the first time earlier this year. Revenue has also grown quickly, jumping 163% to $2.2 billion in 2019, though it\u2019s still just a fraction of DBS\u2019s $11 billion.As for Sea\u2019s $1.46 billion net loss last year? Jacobs isn\u2019t bothered by it. \u201cThey are thoughtful and prudent about building a business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very much of the view that the company has all this under control.\u201dNot everyone is convinced.DBS Bank Ltd. analyst Sachin Mittal downgraded his recommendation on Sea to sell in July, citing Indonesia\u2019s new tax regulations for cross-border transactions and the likelihood of the company burning through cash to grow its payments business. \u201cThere is a tech bubble right now,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSea\u2019s stock is overvalued and it\u2019s partly a reflection of the industry.\u201dWhile short sellers have closed out bets against Sea at a rapid clip in recent weeks, they still have a bearish position worth more than $3 billion, or about 8% of the stock\u2019s free float, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. \u201cMark-to-market losses may have forced shorts out of their position,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. \u201cBut they may still have a negative outlook.\u201dSkeptics note that Sea faces deep-pocketed competitors in all of its main businesses, from Lazada to Grab Holdings Inc. and a slew of other up-and-comers in digital finance. Meanwhile, Sea\u2019s gaming unit has yet to prove it\u2019s more than just a one-hit wonder.Read more: Alibaba Helps Asia\u2019s Malls Go Online After Virus Upends Retail\u201cWe could have a post-Covid situation where the jack-up in revenue does not materialize, and the gaming business is doing well but rests on only one popular game,\u201d said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer equity research at Tellimer Ltd.Sea optimists see little reason to cash in. In fact, Georg Krijgh, founder and head of the investment team at Amsterdam-based Fratres, said his firm\u2019s Knight Tech Fund, which has 150 million euros ($177 million) under management, plans to add to its Sea holdings.The stock is already the fund\u2019s second-largest position after Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company that has gained more than 500% in the past 18 months. \u201cThere are always people who like to short excellent companies such as Sea, Tesla or Carvana, mainly based on the argument of a high valuation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inferior strategy.\u201dSea\u2019s biggest challenge now may have less to do with execution than with meeting investors\u2019 \u201csky-high\u201d expectations, said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In the past seven days alone, Sea\u2019s stock has soared 28% to record.For his part, Li appears well aware that the bar has increased. It\u2019s been hard not to notice with everyone calling his company a Southeast Asian mashup of Tencent and Alibaba, two of the most successful businesses in history.\u201cWe learned a lot from those pioneers,\u201d said Li, who has an estimated net worth of $7.5 billion. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we don\u2019t need to be their mini versions. We can just be ourselves.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.
