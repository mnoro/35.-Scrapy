But at least one bank involved said the records were not authentic. The post, originally published on the overseas hacker site Raidforums, offered to sell customer information from several Chinese banks and insurance companies, including Bank of Shanghai, the Industrial Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, China Merchants Bank and Ping An Insurance. Information for sale includes customers\u2019 names, phone numbers, identification numbers and home addresses. The online thread, published under the pseudonym \u201ctogoodforthisshit,\u201d listed a number of personal records as examples. An Industrial Bank spokesperson told Caixin that information in the post did not match the bank\u2019s customer records. The person said the information could be forged, and the bank reserves the right to resort to legal measures. Other institutions involved declined to comment. Caixin learned that the institutions have reported the news to regulatory bodies for investigation. Caixin contacted a person listed in the post as an Industrial Bank credit card holder. The person said the private information was correct, but he was not the bank\u2019s credit card client. A person from another bank told Caixin that the bank obtained part of the data being offered for sale through a third party for verification and found that most of the information didn\u2019t match its records. Related government authorities launched an investigation, the source said on condition of anonymity. An executive at a financial risk control company said Chinese financial institutions are exposed to rising information security risks from external attacks by hackers and internal leaks. In late 2017, the central bank penalized 47 financial institutions in central China\u2019s Henan province, levying fines totaling 7.16 million yuan ($1 million), for data falsification and information leaks. The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission in 2018 issued guidelines to toughen requirements for financial institutions\u2019 management of customer data and privacy protection. Under Chinese law, banking employees who leak customer data could face a criminal charge of infringing citizens' personal information and be subject to as many as seven years in prison.

It was listed on the SSE in April 2002 and on the HKEX in September 2006. At end-2019, CMB\u2019s total assets amounted to Rmb7.4tr while gross loans and total deposits amounted to Rmb4.5tr and Rmb4.9tr respectively.

CMB\u2019s FY19 earnings of Rmb92.9bn, up 15.3% y-o-y, was in line with our and consensus estimates. We like CMB\u2019s strong double-digit earnings growth, improving asset quality trend (NPL ratio fell 20bps y-o-y), sufficient capital level, and increasing dividend payout (from 30% to 33%). The key concern is its NIM\u2019s 17bps q-o-q decline to 2.4% mainly due to shifting part of retail loans to ABS which squeezed margins. We note that CMB normally shifts part of its asset allocation to ABS at year-end to free up its loan capacity. Entering FY20, management expects NIM to be under pressure due to smaller high-yield asset contribution, partially offset by falling interbank funding costs. However, NII is expected to keep growing stably y-o-y helped by its ~10% loan growth target. Where we differ: We cut our FY20/21F earnings forecasts by 2.8%/5.4% to reflect lower-than-expected NIM and credit card contribution. However, we expect WMP to become the next growth engine for CMB helped by increasing AUMs and transactions through mobile apps. Asset quality remains benign driven by CMB\u2019s strategy to secure better-quality borrowers. Overall, we expect CMB\u2019s earnings growth to be 9.8%/12.2% in FY20/21F after factoring in COVID-19 impacts. Potential catalysts: Improving asset quality from credit card loans and better-than-expected NIM trend are potential share price drivers. Risks Asset quality remains a key concern for investors as deteriorating asset quality will weigh on credit cost and its profitability. Macro headwinds will also weigh on CMB\u2019s NPLs and retail businesses. Other risks include tighter rules on WMPs. Valuation We cut our TP to HK$43.3/RMB40.2 from HK$45.3/Rmb42.1 based on DDM, assuming 13% COE, 6% terminal growth, and 14% ROE. CMB\u2019s share price has fallen 15.9% since the coronavirus outbreak first started and is now trading at 1.1x FY20F P/BV, or -1SD below its five-year average, reaching a three-year low valuation. We believe the stock has been oversold given its strong retail banking position in China. Our TPs imply 1.5x FY20F P/BV for its H-share/A-share, in line with global peers.
