[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz A Visit to Europe In what country does Real Madrid play? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

The capital and main commercial and financial centre is Cardiff . Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz Places in Music From what country does the band Rush come? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

Mid and West Wales Fire Service said it had attended eight flooding incidents in Aberystwyth in Ceredigion since 14:30 BST on Monday. Photographs from the university town showed vehicles struggling to get through flooded streets. The whole of Wales is covered by a Met Office yellow thunderstorm warning until midnight. Image copyright Rhian Toghill Image caption Rhian Toghill caught the moment this lightning bolt struck the Menai Strait from Caernarfon The forecaster warned there was a small chance homes could flood quickly. Aberystwyth resident Joe Easton said he returned from shopping in the town to find the ground floor of his home under water. Image caption Joe Easton returned home to find the ground floor under water \"I can't think of a way to describe it - apocalyptical is probably the best way,\" he said. \"We went to Home Bargains earlier and it was just coming out of the ground.\" Image caption The ground floor of Joe Easton's home was under water He said he realised it meant his home would be flooded. \"We were moving house. We came back and most of our stuff was already gone. There was about two foot of water.\" Wales weather warning as 'severe' thunderstorms expected The first service said others areas affected included Gower in Swansea, Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire and New Quay in Ceredigion, which had over 100 lightning strikes in an hour. Image caption Vehicles in Aberystwyth have had to drive through flood water A second yellow thunderstorm weather covering Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Powys and Wrexham came into force at 16:00 BST and runs until 03:00 on Tuesday. Parts of the region have seen some power cuts, around Trawsfynydd, Llanberis, Llanwnda and Rhosgadfan in Gwynedd, at Dolwyddelan, Betws-y-Coed and Rhos-on-Sea in Conwy,  and at Brynsiencyn and Llanddona on Anglesey. Image caption The owner of this restaurant in Aberystwyth said they had been flooded before \"but not like this\" North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to a house at Nasareth, south of Caernarfon in Gwynedd, after it was struck by lightning, but no further action was needed.

[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

The capital and main commercial and financial centre is Cardiff . Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz Traveler\u2019s Guide to Europe What is the capital of The Netherlands? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

Mid and West Wales Fire Service said it had attended eight flooding incidents in Aberystwyth in Ceredigion since 14:30 BST on Monday. Photographs from the university town showed vehicles struggling to get through flooded streets. The whole of Wales is covered by a Met Office yellow thunderstorm warning until midnight. Image copyright Rhian Toghill Image caption Rhian Toghill caught the moment this lightning bolt struck the Menai Strait from Caernarfon The forecaster warned there was a small chance homes could flood quickly. Aberystwyth resident Joe Easton said he returned from shopping in the town to find the ground floor of his home under water. Image caption Joe Easton returned home to find the ground floor under water \"I can't think of a way to describe it - apocalyptical is probably the best way,\" he said. \"We went to Home Bargains earlier and it was just coming out of the ground.\" Image caption The ground floor of Joe Easton's home was under water He said he realised it meant his home would be flooded. \"We were moving house. We came back and most of our stuff was already gone. There was about two foot of water.\" Wales weather warning as 'severe' thunderstorms expected The first service said others areas affected included Gower in Swansea, Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire and New Quay in Ceredigion, which had over 100 lightning strikes in an hour. Image caption Vehicles in Aberystwyth have had to drive through flood water A second yellow thunderstorm weather covering Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Powys and Wrexham came into force at 16:00 BST and runs until 03:00 on Tuesday. Parts of the region have seen some power cuts, around Trawsfynydd, Llanberis, Llanwnda and Rhosgadfan in Gwynedd, at Dolwyddelan, Betws-y-Coed and Rhos-on-Sea in Conwy,  and at Brynsiencyn and Llanddona on Anglesey. Image caption The owner of this restaurant in Aberystwyth said they had been flooded before \"but not like this\" North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to a house at Nasareth, south of Caernarfon in Gwynedd, after it was struck by lightning, but no further action was needed. Council staff in Gwynedd were also asked to deal with some flash flooding on the coast at Barmouth, while motorists were warned of flooding on the A5 trunk road between Betws-y-Coed and Capel Curig.

[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz Know Your UK Geography Quiz Which countries occupy the island of Great Britain? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

Mid and West Wales Fire Service said it had attended eight flooding incidents in Aberystwyth in Ceredigion since 14:30 BST on Monday. Photographs from the university town showed vehicles struggling to get through flooded streets. The whole of Wales is covered by a Met Office yellow thunderstorm warning until midnight. Image copyright Rhian Toghill Image caption Rhian Toghill caught the moment this lightning bolt struck the Menai Strait from Caernarfon The forecaster warned there was a small chance homes could flood quickly. Aberystwyth resident Joe Easton said he returned from shopping in the town to find the ground floor of his home under water. Image caption Joe Easton returned home to find the ground floor under water \"I can't think of a way to describe it - apocalyptical is probably the best way,\" he said. \"We went to Home Bargains earlier and it was just coming out of the ground.\" Image caption The ground floor of Joe Easton's home was under water He said he realised it meant his home would be flooded. \"We were moving house. We came back and most of our stuff was already gone. There was about two foot of water.\" Wales weather warning as 'severe' thunderstorms expected The first service said others areas affected included Gower in Swansea, Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire and New Quay in Ceredigion, which had over 100 lightning strikes in an hour.

Parts of the region have seen some power cuts, around Trawsfynydd, Llanberis, Llanwnda and Rhosgadfan in Gwynedd, at Dolwyddelan, Betws-y-Coed and Rhos-on-Sea in Conwy,  and at Brynsiencyn and Llanddona on Anglesey. Image caption The owner of this restaurant in Aberystwyth said they had been flooded before \"but not like this\" North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to a house at Nasareth, south of Caernarfon in Gwynedd, after it was struck by lightning, but no further action was needed.

[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz Know Your UK Geography Quiz Which of these rivers does not flow into the English Channel? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

Mid and West Wales Fire Service said it had attended eight flooding incidents in Aberystwyth in Ceredigion since 14:30 BST on Monday. Photographs from the university town showed vehicles struggling to get through flooded streets. The whole of Wales is covered by a Met Office yellow thunderstorm warning until midnight. Image copyright Rhian Toghill Image caption Rhian Toghill caught the moment this lightning bolt struck the Menai Strait from Caernarfon The forecaster warned there was a small chance homes could flood quickly. Aberystwyth resident Joe Easton said he returned from shopping in the town to find the ground floor of his home under water. Image caption Joe Easton returned home to find the ground floor under water \"I can't think of a way to describe it - apocalyptical is probably the best way,\" he said. \"We went to Home Bargains earlier and it was just coming out of the ground.\" Image caption The ground floor of Joe Easton's home was under water He said he realised it meant his home would be flooded. \"We were moving house. We came back and most of our stuff was already gone.

[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

The capital and main commercial and financial centre is Cardiff . Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz Traveler\u2019s Guide to Europe Which of these regions does Norway belong to? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

Mid and West Wales Fire Service said it had attended eight flooding incidents in Aberystwyth in Ceredigion since 14:30 BST on Monday. Photographs from the university town showed vehicles struggling to get through flooded streets. The whole of Wales is covered by a Met Office yellow thunderstorm warning until midnight. Image copyright Rhian Toghill Image caption Rhian Toghill caught the moment this lightning bolt struck the Menai Strait from Caernarfon The forecaster warned there was a small chance homes could flood quickly. Aberystwyth resident Joe Easton said he returned from shopping in the town to find the ground floor of his home under water. Image caption Joe Easton returned home to find the ground floor under water \"I can't think of a way to describe it - apocalyptical is probably the best way,\" he said. \"We went to Home Bargains earlier and it was just coming out of the ground.\" Image caption The ground floor of Joe Easton's home was under water He said he realised it meant his home would be flooded. \"We were moving house. We came back and most of our stuff was already gone. There was about two foot of water.\" Wales weather warning as 'severe' thunderstorms expected The first service said others areas affected included Gower in Swansea, Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire and New Quay in Ceredigion, which had over 100 lightning strikes in an hour. Image caption Vehicles in Aberystwyth have had to drive through flood water A second yellow thunderstorm weather covering Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Powys and Wrexham came into force at 16:00 BST and runs until 03:00 on Tuesday. Parts of the region have seen some power cuts, around Trawsfynydd, Llanberis, Llanwnda and Rhosgadfan in Gwynedd, at Dolwyddelan, Betws-y-Coed and Rhos-on-Sea in Conwy,  and at Brynsiencyn and Llanddona on Anglesey. Image caption The owner of this restaurant in Aberystwyth said they had been flooded before \"but not like this\" North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to a house at Nasareth, south of Caernarfon in Gwynedd, after it was struck by lightning, but no further action was needed. Council staff in Gwynedd were also asked to deal with some flash flooding on the coast at Barmouth, while motorists were warned of flooding on the A5 trunk road between Betws-y-Coed and Capel Curig.

[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz Passport to Europe What is the largest lake in Europe? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

Mid and West Wales Fire Service said it had attended eight flooding incidents in Aberystwyth in Ceredigion since 14:30 BST on Monday. Photographs from the university town showed vehicles struggling to get through flooded streets. The whole of Wales is covered by a Met Office yellow thunderstorm warning until midnight. Image copyright Rhian Toghill Image caption Rhian Toghill caught the moment this lightning bolt struck the Menai Strait from Caernarfon The forecaster warned there was a small chance homes could flood quickly. Aberystwyth resident Joe Easton said he returned from shopping in the town to find the ground floor of his home under water. Image caption Joe Easton returned home to find the ground floor under water \"I can't think of a way to describe it - apocalyptical is probably the best way,\" he said. \"We went to Home Bargains earlier and it was just coming out of the ground.\" Image caption The ground floor of Joe Easton's home was under water He said he realised it meant his home would be flooded. \"We were moving house. We came back and most of our stuff was already gone. There was about two foot of water.\" Wales weather warning as 'severe' thunderstorms expected The first service said others areas affected included Gower in Swansea, Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire and New Quay in Ceredigion, which had over 100 lightning strikes in an hour. Image caption Vehicles in Aberystwyth have had to drive through flood water A second yellow thunderstorm weather covering Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Powys and Wrexham came into force at 16:00 BST and runs until 03:00 on Tuesday. Parts of the region have seen some power cuts, around Trawsfynydd, Llanberis, Llanwnda and Rhosgadfan in Gwynedd, at Dolwyddelan, Betws-y-Coed and Rhos-on-Sea in Conwy,  and at Brynsiencyn and Llanddona on Anglesey. Image caption The owner of this restaurant in Aberystwyth said they had been flooded before \"but not like this\" North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to a house at Nasareth, south of Caernarfon in Gwynedd, after it was struck by lightning, but no further action was needed. Council staff in Gwynedd were also asked to deal with some flash flooding on the coast at Barmouth, while motorists were warned of flooding on the A5 trunk road between Betws-y-Coed and Capel Curig.

[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

The capital and main commercial and financial centre is Cardiff . Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz A Visit to Europe Which of these is not a river in Spain? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

Mid and West Wales Fire Service said it had attended eight flooding incidents in Aberystwyth in Ceredigion since 14:30 BST on Monday. Photographs from the university town showed vehicles struggling to get through flooded streets. The whole of Wales is covered by a Met Office yellow thunderstorm warning until midnight. Image copyright Rhian Toghill Image caption Rhian Toghill caught the moment this lightning bolt struck the Menai Strait from Caernarfon The forecaster warned there was a small chance homes could flood quickly. Aberystwyth resident Joe Easton said he returned from shopping in the town to find the ground floor of his home under water. Image caption Joe Easton returned home to find the ground floor under water \"I can't think of a way to describe it - apocalyptical is probably the best way,\" he said. \"We went to Home Bargains earlier and it was just coming out of the ground.\" Image caption The ground floor of Joe Easton's home was under water He said he realised it meant his home would be flooded. \"We were moving house. We came back and most of our stuff was already gone. There was about two foot of water.\" Wales weather warning as 'severe' thunderstorms expected The first service said others areas affected included Gower in Swansea, Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire and New Quay in Ceredigion, which had over 100 lightning strikes in an hour. Image caption Vehicles in Aberystwyth have had to drive through flood water A second yellow thunderstorm weather covering Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Gwynedd, Anglesey, Powys and Wrexham came into force at 16:00 BST and runs until 03:00 on Tuesday. Parts of the region have seen some power cuts, around Trawsfynydd, Llanberis, Llanwnda and Rhosgadfan in Gwynedd, at Dolwyddelan, Betws-y-Coed and Rhos-on-Sea in Conwy,  and at Brynsiencyn and Llanddona on Anglesey. Image caption The owner of this restaurant in Aberystwyth said they had been flooded before \"but not like this\" North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to a house at Nasareth, south of Caernarfon in Gwynedd, after it was struck by lightning, but no further action was needed. Council staff in Gwynedd were also asked to deal with some flash flooding on the coast at Barmouth, while motorists were warned of flooding on the A5 trunk road between Betws-y-Coed and Capel Curig.

[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz It\u2019s All in the Name What is another name for Burma? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

Mid and West Wales Fire Service said it had attended eight flooding incidents in Aberystwyth in Ceredigion since 14:30 BST on Monday. Photographs from the university town showed vehicles struggling to get through flooded streets. The whole of Wales is covered by a Met Office yellow thunderstorm warning until midnight. Image copyright Rhian Toghill Image caption Rhian Toghill caught the moment this lightning bolt struck the Menai Strait from Caernarfon The forecaster warned there was a small chance homes could flood quickly. Aberystwyth resident Joe Easton said he returned from shopping in the town to find the ground floor of his home under water. Image caption Joe Easton returned home to find the ground floor under water \"I can't think of a way to describe it - apocalyptical is probably the best way,\" he said. \"We went to Home Bargains earlier and it was just coming out of the ground.\" Image caption The ground floor of Joe Easton's home was under water He said he realised it meant his home would be flooded. \"We were moving house. We came back and most of our stuff was already gone. There was about two foot of water.\" Wales weather warning as 'severe' thunderstorms expected The first service said others areas affected included Gower in Swansea, Llandeilo in Carmarthenshire and New Quay in Ceredigion, which had over 100 lightning strikes in an hour.

Parts of the region have seen some power cuts, around Trawsfynydd, Llanberis, Llanwnda and Rhosgadfan in Gwynedd, at Dolwyddelan, Betws-y-Coed and Rhos-on-Sea in Conwy,  and at Brynsiencyn and Llanddona on Anglesey. Image caption The owner of this restaurant in Aberystwyth said they had been flooded before \"but not like this\" North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was called to a house at Nasareth, south of Caernarfon in Gwynedd, after it was struck by lightning, but no further action was needed. Council staff in Gwynedd were also asked to deal with some flash flooding on the coast at Barmouth, while motorists were warned of flooding on the A5 trunk road between Betws-y-Coed and Capel Curig.

[10] It is bordered by England to the east , the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate . Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd 's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England 's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glynd\u0175r briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century. The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 . Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century. Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by Lloyd George , was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party . Welsh national feeling grew over the century; Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962. Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998 , Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales \u2013 is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters . At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield 's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales , including Cardiff , Swansea , Newport and the nearby valleys . Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, incomes focus on the public sector , light and service industries and tourism . In livestock farming including dairy farming Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency . Although Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain and, while a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, the country has retained a distinct cultural identity . Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west. From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the \"land of song\", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition. At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games , Wales has its own national teams, though at the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete as part of a Great Britain team . Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.

[11] Anglo-Saxons came to use the term to refer to the Britons in particular; the plural form W\u0113alas evolved into the name for their territory, Wales. [12] [12] [13] Historically in Britain , the words were not restricted to modern Wales or to the Welsh but were used to refer to anything that Anglo-Saxons associated with Britons, including other non-Germanic territories in Britain (e.g. Cornwall ) and places in Anglo-Saxon territory associated with Britons (e.g. Walworth in County Durham and Walton in West Yorkshire ). [14] The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales. These words (both of which are pronounced [\u02c8k\u0259m.r\u0268] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \"fellow-countrymen\", [15] [16] and probably came into use before the 7th century. [17] [18] In literature, they could be spelt Kymry or Cymry , regardless of whether it referred to the people or their homeland. [15] The Latinised forms of these names, Cambrian , Cambric and Cambria , survive as names such as the Cambrian Mountains and the Cambrian geological period . [19] [20] History Main articles: History of Wales and Timeline of Welsh history Prehistoric origins See also: Prehistoric Wales Bryn Celli Ddu , a late Neolithic chambered tomb on Anglesey Wales has been inhabited by modern humans for at least 29,000 years. [21] Continuous human habitation dates from the end of the last ice age , between 12,000 and 10,000 years before present (BP) , when Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from central Europe began to migrate to Great Britain. At that time sea levels were much lower than today. Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250\u00a0BP, the warmer climate allowing the area to become heavily wooded. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea . By 8,000 BP the British Peninsula had become an island. [22] [23] By the beginning of the Neolithic (c.\u00a06,000\u00a0BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about 33 feet (10 metres) lower than today. [24] [25] [26] The historian John Davies theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod 's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion , of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time. [27] Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing their lifestyles from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers about 6,000\u00a0BP \u2013 the Neolithic Revolution . [27] [28] They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and built cromlechs such as Pentre Ifan , Bryn Celli Ddu and Parc Cwm long cairn between about 5,800\u00a0BP and 5,500\u00a0BP. [29] [30] Over the following centuries they assimilated immigrants and adopted ideas from Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic cultures. Some historians, such as John T. Koch , consider Wales in the Late Bronze Age as part of a maritime trading-networked culture that included other Celtic nations . [31] [32] [33] This \"Atlantic-Celtic\" view is opposed by others who hold that the Celtic languages derive their origins from the more easterly Hallstatt culture . [34] By the time of the Roman invasion of Britain the area of modern Wales had been divided among the tribes of the Deceangli , Ordovices , Cornovii , Demetae and Silures for centuries. [27] Roman era Main article: Wales in the Roman era The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48, took 30 years to complete and lasted over 300 years. The campaigns of conquest were opposed by two native tribes: the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation, save for the southern coastal region of south Wales where there is a legacy of Romanisation. [35] The only town in Wales founded by the Romans, Caerwent , is in south east Wales. [36] Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales, became Roman civitates . [37] Wales had a rich mineral wealth. The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as lesser amounts of zinc and silver . [38] No significant industries located in Wales in this time. [38] This was largely a matter of circumstance, as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination, and the forested, mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation. Latin became the official language of Wales, though the people continued to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete, the upper classes came to consider themselves Roman, particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire. [39] Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely; state persecution ceased in the 4th\u00a0century, as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313. [39] Early historians, including the 6th-century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history. [40] In that year, the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig, stripped Britain of troops to launch a successful bid for imperial power, continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor, and transferring power to local leaders. [41] [42] The earliest Welsh genealogies cite Maximus as the founder of several royal dynasties, [43] [44] and as the father of the Welsh Nation. [40] He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain, and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales . [45] Post-Roman era See also: Sub-Roman Britain Britain in AD 500: The areas shaded pink on the map were inhabited by the Britons , here labelled Welsh . The pale blue areas in the east were controlled by Germanic tribes , whilst the pale green areas to the north were inhabited by the Gaels and Picts . The 400-year period following the collapse of Roman rule is the most difficult to interpret in the history of Wales. [39] After the Roman departure in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples . Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades , it was thought that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. [46] This idea has been discarded with the emergence of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic , or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas. [47] By AD 500 the land that would become Wales had divided into a number of kingdoms free from Anglo-Saxon rule. [39] The kingdoms of Gwynedd , Powys , Dyfed and Seisyllwg , Morgannwg and Gwent emerged as independent Welsh successor states . [39] Archaeological evidence, in the Low Countries and what was to become England, shows early Anglo-Saxon migration to Great Britain reversed between 500 and 550, which concurs with Frankish chronicles. [48] John Davies notes this as consistent with the British victory at Badon Hill , attributed to Arthur by Nennius . [48] Having lost much of what is now the West Midlands to Mercia in the 6th and early 7th centuries, a resurgent late-7th-century Powys checked Mercian advances. Aethelbald of Mercia , looking to defend recently acquired lands, had built Wat's Dyke . According to Davies, this have been with the agreement of king Elisedd ap Gwylog of Powys, as this boundary, extending north from the valley of the River Severn to the Dee estuary, gave him Oswestry . [49] Another theory, after carbon dating placed the dyke's existence 300 years earlier, is that it was built by the post-Roman rulers of Wroxeter . [50] King Offa of Mercia seems to have continued this initiative when he created a larger earthwork, now known as Offa's Dyke ( Clawdd Offa ). Davies wrote of Cyril Fox 's study of Offa's Dyke: \"In the planning of it, there was a degree of consultation with the kings of Powys and Gwent. On the Long Mountain near Trelystan, the dyke veers to the east, leaving the fertile slopes in the hands of the Welsh; near Rhiwabon , it was designed to ensure that Cadell ap Brochwel retained possession of the Fortress of Penygadden.\" And, for Gwent, Offa had the dyke built \"on the eastern crest of the gorge, clearly with the intention of recognizing that the River Wye and its traffic belonged to the kingdom of Gwent.\" [49] However, Fox's interpretations of both the length and purpose of the Dyke have been questioned by more recent research. [51] In 853, the Vikings raided Anglesey, but in 856, Rhodri Mawr defeated and killed their leader, Gorm. [52] The Britons of Wales made peace with the Vikings and Anarawd ap Rhodri allied with the Norsemen occupying Northumbria to conquer the north. [53] This alliance later broke down and Anarawd came to an agreement with Alfred , king of Wessex , with whom he fought against the west Welsh. According to Annales Cambriae , in 894, \"Anarawd came with the Angles and laid waste Ceredigion and Ystrad Tywi .\" [54] Medieval Wales See also: Norman invasion of Wales and Wales in the Late Middle Ages North Wales Principalities , 1267\u201376 Hywel Dda enthroned The southern and eastern parts of Great Britain lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as Lloegyr (Modern Welsh Lloegr ), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally and which came to refer to England as a whole. [n 1] The Germanic tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called Saeson , meaning \" Saxons \". The Anglo-Saxons called the Romano-British * Walha , meaning 'Romanised foreigner' or 'stranger'. [55] The Welsh continued to call themselves Brythoniaid (Brythons or Britons) well into the Middle Ages , though the first written evidence of the use of Cymru and y Cymry is found in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan ( Moliant Cadwallon , by Afan Ferddig ) c. 633 . [12] In Armes Prydain , believed to be written around 930\u2013942, the words Cymry and Cymro are used as often as 15 times. [56] However, from the Anglo-Saxon settlement onwards, the people gradually begin to adopt the name Cymry over Brythoniad . [57] From 800 onwards, a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr 's ( r. 844\u201377) inheritance of Gwynedd and Powys . His sons founded the three dynasties of ( Aberffraw for Gwynedd , Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys ). Rhodri 's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900\u201350) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. [58] Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986\u201399) of Deheubarth , ( Hywel 's grandson), temporarily ousted the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys . Maredudd 's great-grandson (through his daughter Princess Angharad ) Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (r. 1039\u201363) conquered his cousins' realms from his base in Powys , and extended his authority into England. John Davies states that Gruffydd was \"the only Welsh king ever to rule over the entire territory of Wales... Thus, from about 1057 until his death in 1063, the whole of Wales recognised the kingship of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn . For about seven brief years, Wales was one, under one ruler, a feat with neither precedent nor successor.\" [2] Owain Gwynedd (1100\u201370) of the Aberffraw line was the first Welsh ruler to use the title princeps Wallensium (prince of the Welsh), a title of substance given his victory on the Berwyn Mountains , according to John Davies. [59] Statue of Owain Glynd\u0175r ( c. 1354 or 1359 \u2013 c. 1416 ) at Cardiff City Hall Norman conquest Within four years of the Battle of Hastings (1066), England had been completely subjugated by the Normans . [2] William I of England established a series of lordships, allocated to his most powerful warriors, along the Welsh border, their boundaries fixed only to the east (where they met other feudal properties inside England). [60] Starting in the 1070s, these lords began conquering land in southern and eastern Wales, west of the River Wye .  The frontier region, and any English-held lordships in Wales, became known as Marchia Wallie , the Welsh Marches , in which the Marcher Lords were subject to neither English nor Welsh law . [61] The extent of the March varied as the fortunes of the Marcher Lords and the Welsh princes ebbed and flowed. [62] Owain Gwynedd 's grandson Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173\u20131240), received the fealty of other Welsh lords in 1216 at the council at Aberdyfi , becoming in effect the first Prince of Wales . [63] His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd secured the recognition of the title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. [64] Subsequent disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn 's wife Eleanor , culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England . [65] As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn 's fealty to England in 1277. [65] Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest , the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn 's death and his brother prince Dafydd 's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage to Edward I . [66] Annexation to England The Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for a post-conquest government of the Principality of North Wales from 1284 until 1535/36. [67] It defined Wales as \"annexed and united\" to the English Crown, separate from England but under the same monarch. The king ruled directly in two areas: the Statute divided the north and delegated administrative duties to the Justice of Chester and Justiciar of North Wales , and further south in western Wales the King's authority was delegated to the Justiciar of South Wales .  The existing royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth remained unchanged. [68] To maintain his dominance, Edward constructed a series of castles: Beaumaris , Caernarfon , Harlech and Conwy . His son, the future Edward II , was born at Caernarfon in 1284. [69] He became the first English Prince of Wales in 1301, which at the time provided an income from northwest Wales known as the Principality of Wales . [70] Caernarfon Castle , birthplace of Edward II of England After the failed revolt in 1294\u201395 of Madog ap Llywelyn \u2013 who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document \u2013 and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the last uprising was led by Owain Glynd\u0175r , against Henry IV of England . In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. [71] Glynd\u0175r went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth . The rebellion failed, Owain went into hiding, and nothing was known of him after 1413. [72] Henry Tudor (born in Wales in 1457) seized the throne of England from Richard III in 1485, uniting England and Wales under one royal house. The last remnants of Celtic-tradition Welsh law were abolished and replaced by English law by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 during the reign of Henry VII's son, Henry VIII . [73] In the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales , Wales became unified with the kingdom of England; the \"Principality of Wales\" began to refer to the whole country, though it remained a \"principality\" only in a ceremonial sense. [67] [74] The Marcher Lordships were abolished, and Wales began electing members of the Westminster parliament. [75] Industrial Wales See also: Glamorgan and Lower Swansea valley Dowlais Ironworks (1840) by George Childs (1798\u20131875) Penrhyn Slate Quarries, 1852 Prior to the British Industrial Revolution there were small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. [76] These ranged from those connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles , through to mining and quarrying. [76] Agriculture remained the dominant source of wealth. [76] The emerging industrial period saw the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that connected it with Cornwall's copper mines in the south and the large copper deposits at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. [76] The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the north and the south of the country. [77] In the north, John Wilkinson 's Ironworks at Bersham was a major centre, while in the south, at Merthyr Tydfil , the ironworks of Dowlais , Cyfarthfa , Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. [77] By the 1820s, south Wales produced 40% of all Britain's pig iron . [77] In the late 18th century, slate quarrying began to expand rapidly, most notably in north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, [78] and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying has been described as 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', [79] it is coal mining which became the industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw an explosion in demand. As the South Wales coalfield was exploited, Cardiff, Swansea, Penarth and Barry grew as world exporters of coal. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. [80] Modern Wales Battle at Mametz Wood by Christopher Williams (1918) Historian Kenneth Morgan described Wales on the eve of the First World War as a \"relatively placid, self-confident and successful nation\". The output from the coalfields continued to increase, with the Rhondda Valley recording a peak of 9.6\u00a0million tons of coal extracted in 1913. [81] The First World War (1914\u20131918) saw a total of 272,924 Welshmen under arms, representing 21.5 per cent of the male population. Of these, roughly 35,000 were killed, [82] with particularly heavy losses of Welsh forces at Mametz Wood on the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele . [83] The first quarter of the 20th century also saw a shift in the political landscape of Wales. Since 1865, the Liberal Party had held a parliamentary majority in Wales and, following the general election of 1906 , only one non-Liberal Member of Parliament, Keir Hardie of Merthyr Tydfil , represented a Welsh constituency at Westminster. Yet by 1906, industrial dissension and political militancy had begun to undermine Liberal consensus in the southern coalfields. [84] In 1916, David Lloyd George became the first Welshman to become Prime Minister of Britain. [85] In December 1918, Lloyd George was re-elected at the head of a Conservative-dominated coalition government, and his poor handling of the 1919 coal miners' strike was a key factor in destroying support for the Liberal party in south Wales. [86] The industrial workers of Wales began shifting towards the Labour Party . When in 1908 the Miners' Federation of Great Britain became affiliated to the Labour Party, the four Labour candidates sponsored by miners were all elected as MPs. By 1922, half the Welsh seats at Westminster were held by Labour politicians\u2014the start of a Labour dominance of Welsh politics that continued into the 21st century. [87] After economic growth in the first two decades of the 20th century, Wales' staple industries endured a prolonged slump from the early 1920s to the late 1930s, leading to widespread unemployment and poverty. [88] For the first time in centuries, the population of Wales went into decline; unemployment reduced only with the production demands of the Second World War . [89] The war saw Welsh servicemen and women fight in all major theatres, with some 15,000 of them killed. Bombing raids brought high loss of life as the German Air Force targeted the docks at Swansea , Cardiff and Pembroke . After 1943, 10 per cent of Welsh conscripts aged 18 were sent to work in the coal mines, where there were labour shortages; they became known as Bevin Boys . Pacifist numbers during both World Wars were fairly low, especially in the Second World War, which was seen as a fight against fascism. [90] Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, seeking greater autonomy or independence from the rest of the UK. [91] The term \" England and Wales \" became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and in 1955 Cardiff was proclaimed as Wales' capital. Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society) was formed in 1962, in response to fears that the language might soon die out. [92] Nationalist sentiment grew following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965 to create a reservoir to supply water to the English city of Liverpool . [93] Although 35 of the 36 Welsh MPs voted against the bill (one abstained), Parliament passed the bill and the village of Capel Celyn was submerged, highlighting Wales' powerlessness in her own affairs in the face of the numerical superiority of English MPs in Parliament. [94] Separatist groupings, such as the Free Wales Army and Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru were formed, conducting campaigns from 1963. [95] Prior to the investiture of Charles in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb attacks on infrastructure. [96] [97] At a by-election in 1966, Gwynfor Evans won the parliamentary seat of Carmarthen , Plaid Cymru's first Parliamentary seat. [98] The next year, the Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed and a legal definition of Wales and of the boundary with England were established. [99] By the end of the 1960s, the regional policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. [100] This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, [100] most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period, but this was shown to be optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years. [101] Devolution In a referendum in 1979, Wales voted against the creation of a Welsh assembly with an 80 per cent majority. In 1997, a second referendum on the same issue secured a very narrow majority (50.3 per cent). [102] The National Assembly for Wales ( Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru ) was set up in 1999 (under the Government of Wales Act 1998 ) with the power to determine how Wales' central government budget is spent and administered, although the UK Parliament reserved the right to set limits on its powers. [102] The governments of the United Kingdom and of Wales almost invariably define Wales as a country. [103] [104] The Welsh Government says: \"Wales is not a Principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right.\" [105] [n 2] Government and politics Main article: Politics of Wales See also: Welsh Government ; Politics of the United Kingdom ; and National Assembly for Wales election, 2016 The Senedd building, designed by Richard Rogers , opened on St David's Day 2006 Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. [10] [107] Constitutionally, the UK is a de jure unitary state , its parliament and government in Westminster . In the House of Commons \u2013 the lower house of the UK Parliament \u2013 Wales is represented by 40 MPs (out of 650) from Welsh constituencies . At the 2019 general election , 22 Labour and Labour Co-op MPs were elected, 14 Conservative MPs and 4 Plaid Cymru MPs. [108] The Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for Wales, whose minister the Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet . [109] Following devolution in 1997, the Government of Wales Act 1998 created the National Assembly for Wales . [110] Powers of the Secretary of State for Wales were transferred to the devolved government on 1 July 1999, granting the Assembly the power to decide how the Westminster government's budget for devolved areas is spent and administered. [111] The 1998 Act was amended by the Government of Wales Act 2006 , which enhanced the institution's powers, giving it legislative powers akin to those of the Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly . The Parliament has 60 Members of the Senedd (MS) who are elected to four-year terms under an additional member system . Forty of the MSs represent geographical constituencies , elected under the First Past the Post system. The remaining 20 MSs represent five electoral regions , each including between seven and nine constituencies, using proportional representation . [112] The Senedd must elect a First Minister , who selects ministers to form the Welsh Government . [113] The Assembly was in 2020 renamed Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh Parliament. [114] Areas of responsibility The twenty areas of responsibility devolved to the Welsh Government, known as \"subjects\", include agriculture, economic development, education, health, housing, local government, social services, tourism, transport and the Welsh language. [115] [116] On its creation in 1999, the National Assembly for Wales had no primary legislative powers. [117] In 2007, following passage of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (GoWA 2006), the Assembly developed powers to pass primary legislation known at the time as Assembly Measures on some specific matters within the areas of devolved responsibility. Further matters have been added subsequently, either directly by the UK Parliament or by the UK Parliament approving a Legislative Competence Order (LCO, a request from the National Assembly for additional powers). The GoWA 2006 allows for the Assembly to gain primary lawmaking powers on a more extensive range of matters within the same devolved areas if approved in a referendum. [118] A referendum on extending the law-making powers of the then National Assembly was held on 3 March 2011 and secured a majority for extension. Consequently, the Assembly became empowered to make laws, known as Acts of the Assembly , on all matters in the subject areas, without needing the UK Parliament's agreement. [119] Relations between Wales and foreign states are primarily conducted through the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom , in addition to the Foreign Secretary , and the British Ambassador to the United States . However, the Senedd has its own envoy to America, primarily to promote Wales-specific business interests. The primary Welsh Government Office is based in the Washington British Embassy , with satellites in New York , Chicago , San Francisco , and Atlanta . [120] The United States has also established a caucus to build direct relations with Wales. [121] In the United States Congress, legislators with Welsh heritage and interests in Wales have established the Friends of Wales Caucus . [122] Local government Main article: Local government in Wales See also: History of local government in Wales For the purposes of local government, Wales has been divided into 22 council areas since 1996. These \"principal areas\" [123] are responsible for the provision of all local government services. [124] Law and order Main articles: Cyfraith Hywel , Welsh law , Law of the United Kingdom , and English law See also: Marcher Lord The Old Court House, Ruthin , Denbighshire , built 1401, following Owain Glynd\u0175r 's attack on the town Illustration of a Welsh judge from the Laws of Hywel Dda By tradition, Welsh Law was compiled during an assembly held at Whitland around 930 by Hywel Dda , king of most of Wales between 942 and his death in 950. The 'law of Hywel Dda' ( Welsh : Cyfraith Hywel ), as it became known, codified the previously existing folk laws and legal customs that had evolved in Wales over centuries. Welsh Law emphasised the payment of compensation for a crime to the victim, or the victim's kin, rather than punishment by the ruler. [125] [126] [127] Other than in the Marches , where law was imposed by the Marcher Lords, Welsh Law remained in force in Wales until the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284. Edward I of England annexed the Principality of Wales following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , and Welsh Law was replaced for criminal cases under the Statute. Marcher Law and Welsh Law (for civil cases) remained in force until Henry VIII of England annexed the whole of Wales under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 (often referred to as the Acts of Union of 1536 and 1543), after which English law applied to the whole of Wales. [125] [128] The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and the Anglo-Scottish border town of Berwick ) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise; this Act was repealed with regard to Wales in 1967. English law has been the legal system of England and Wales since 1536. [129] English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court . The three divisions are the Court of Appeal ; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court . Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court . In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales . [130] The Senedd has the authority to draft and approve laws outside of the UK Parliamentary system to meet the specific needs of Wales. Under powers approved by a referendum held in March 2011, it is empowered to pass primary legislation, at the time referred to as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales but now known as an Act of the Senedd in relation to twenty subjects listed in the Government of Wales Act 2006 such as health and education. Through this primary legislation, the Welsh Government can then also enact more specific subordinate legislation . [131] Wales is served by four regional police forces, Dyfed-Powys Police , Gwent Police , North Wales Police and South Wales Police . [132] There are five prisons in Wales ; four in the southern half of the country and one in Wrexham . Wales has no women's prisons; female inmates are imprisoned in England. [133] [134] Geography and natural history Snowdon , Gwynedd , the highest mountain in Wales Main article: Geography of Wales See also: List of settlements in Wales by population and List of towns in Wales Wales is a generally mountainous country on the western side of central southern Great Britain . [135] It is about 170 miles (270\u00a0km) north\u2013south. [136] The oft-quoted ' size of Wales ' is about 20,779\u00a0km 2 (8,023\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). [137] Wales is bordered by England to the east and by sea in all other directions: the Irish Sea to the north and west, St George's Channel and the Celtic Sea to the southwest and the Bristol Channel to the south. [138] [139] Wales has about 1,680 miles (2,700\u00a0km) of coastline (along the mean high water mark), including the mainland, Anglesey and Holyhead. [140] Over 50 islands lie off the Welsh mainland; the largest being Anglesey , in the north-west. [141] Much of Wales' diverse landscape is mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last ice age, the Devensian glaciation . The highest mountains in Wales are in Snowdonia ( Eryri ), of which five are over 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). The highest of these is Snowdon ( Yr Wyddfa ), at 1,085\u00a0m (3,560\u00a0ft). [142] [143] The 14 Welsh mountains, or 15 if including Garnedd Uchaf\u00a0\u2013 often discounted because of its low topographic prominence \u2013 over 3,000 feet (910 metres) high are known collectively as the Welsh 3000s and are located in a small area in the north-west. [144] The highest outside the 3000s is Aran Fawddwy , at 905 metres (2,969 feet), in the south of Snowdonia. [145] The Brecon Beacons ( Bannau Brycheiniog ) are in the south (highest point Pen y Fan , at 886 metres (2,907 feet)), [146] and are joined by the Cambrian Mountains in Mid Wales (highest point Pumlumon , at 752 metres (2,467 feet)). [147] Relief map of Wales: Topography above 600 feet (180\u00a0m) National Parks Wales has three national parks : Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast . It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty ; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley , the Gower Peninsula , the Ll\u0177n Peninsula , and the Wye Valley . [148] The Gower Peninsula was the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. As of 2019, the coastline of Wales had 40 Blue Flag beaches , three Blue Flag marinas and one Blue Flag boat operator. [149] Despite its heritage and award-winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies /south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. In 1859 over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales in a hurricane that saw more than 800 lives lost across Britain. [150] The greatest single loss occurred with the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in which 459 people died. [151] The 19th century saw over 100 vessels lost with an average loss of 78 sailors per year. [152] Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. [152] Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996. [153] The first border between Wales and England was zonal, apart from around the River Wye, which was the first accepted boundary. [154] Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. [154] The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching from the mouth of the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. [154] Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law. [154] Geology Main article: Geology of Wales The earliest geological period of the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian , takes its name from the Cambrian Mountains , where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. [155] [156] In the mid-19th century, Roderick Murchison and Adam Sedgwick used their studies of Welsh geology to establish certain principles of stratigraphy and palaeontology . The next two periods of the Paleozoic era, the Ordovician and Silurian , were named after ancient Celtic tribes from this area.

It has a changeable, maritime climate and is one of the wettest countries in Europe. [159] [160] Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. [159] [161] The long summer days and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53\u00b0 43\u2032 N and 51\u00b0 38\u2032 N). Aberystwyth , at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17\u00a0hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over seven\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0half hours. [162] The country's wide geographic variations cause localised differences in sunshine, rainfall and temperature. Average annual coastal temperatures reach 10.5\u00a0\u00b0C (51\u00a0\u00b0F) and in low lying inland areas, 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) lower. It becomes cooler at higher altitudes; annual temperatures decrease on average approximately 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C (0.9\u00a0\u00b0F) each 100 metres (330 feet) of altitude. Consequently, the higher parts of Snowdonia experience average annual temperatures of 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F). [159] Temperatures in Wales remain higher than would otherwise be expected at its latitude because of the North Atlantic Drift , a branch of the Gulf Stream . The ocean current, bringing warmer water to northerly latitudes, has a similar effect on most of north-west Europe. As well as its influence on Wales' coastal areas, air warmed by the Gulf Stream blows further inland with the prevailing winds. [163] At low elevations, summers tend to be warm and sunny. Average maximum temperatures range between 19 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (66 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). Winters tend to be fairly wet, but rainfall is rarely excessive and the temperature usually stays above freezing. Spring and autumn feel quite similar and the temperatures tend to stay above 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 also the average annual daytime temperature. [164] The sunniest months are between May and August. The south-western coast is the sunniest part of Wales, averaging over 1700 hours of sunshine annually, with Tenby , Pembrokeshire, its sunniest town. The dullest time of year is between November and January. The least sunny areas are the mountains, some parts of which average less than 1200 hours of sunshine annually. [159] [160] The prevailing wind is south-westerly. Coastal areas are the windiest, gales occur most often during winter, on average between 15 and 30 days each year, depending on location. Inland, gales average fewer than six days annually. [159] Wales pictured from the International Space Station Rainfall patterns show significant variation. The further west, the higher the expected rainfall; up to 40% more. [160] At low elevations, rain is unpredictable at any time of year, although the showers tend to be shorter in summer. [164] The uplands of Wales have most rain, normally more than 50 days of rain during the winter months (December to February), falling to around 35 rainy days during the summer months (June to August). Annual rainfall in Snowdonia averages between 3,000 millimetres (120\u00a0in) ( Blaenau Ffestiniog ) and 5,000 millimetres (200\u00a0in) ( Snowdon 's summit). [160] The likelihood is that it will fall as sleet or snow when the temperature falls below 5\u00a0\u00b0C (41\u00a0\u00b0F) and snow tends to be lying on the ground there for an average of 30 days a year. Snow falls several times each winter in inland areas but is relatively uncommon around the coast. Average annual rainfall in those areas can be less than 1,000 millimetres (39\u00a0in). [159] [160] Highest maximum temperature: 35.2\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) at Hawarden Bridge , Flintshire on 2 August 1990. [165] Lowest minimum temperature: \u221223.3\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221210\u00a0\u00b0F) at Rhayader , Radnorshire (now Powys ) on 21 January 1940. [165] Maximum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 354.3 hours at Dale Fort , Pembrokeshire in July 1955. [166] Minimum number of hours of sunshine in a month: 2.7 hours at Llwynon, Brecknockshire in January 1962. [166] Maximum rainfall in a day (0900 UTC \u2212 0900 UTC): 211 millimetres (8.3\u00a0in) at Rhondda , Glamorgan, on 11 November 1929. [167] Wettest spot \u2013 an average of 4,473 millimetres (176\u00a0in) rain a year at Crib Goch in Snowdonia, Gwynedd (making it also the wettest spot in the United Kingdom). [168] Flora and fauna See also: Fauna of Great Britain , Flora of Great Britain , and List of birds of Wales Wales' wildlife is typical of Britain with several distinctions. Because of its long coastline, Wales hosts a variety of seabirds. The coasts and surrounding islands are home to colonies of gannets , Manx shearwater , puffins , kittiwakes , shags and razorbills . In comparison, with 60 per cent of Wales above the 150m contour, the country also supports a variety of upland habitat birds, including raven and ring ouzel . [169] [170] Birds of prey include the merlin , hen harrier and the red kite , a national symbol of Welsh wildlife. [171] In total, more than 200 different species of bird have been seen at the RSPB reserve at Conwy , including seasonal visitors. [172] Larger mammals, including brown bears, wolves and wildcats, died out during the Norman period. Today, mammals include shrews, voles, badgers, otters, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs and fifteen species of bat. Two species of small rodent, the yellow-necked mouse and the dormouse , are of special Welsh note being found at the historically undisturbed border area. [173] The pine marten , which has been sighted occasionally, has not been officially recorded since the 1950s. The polecat was nearly driven to extinction in Britain, but hung on in Wales and is now rapidly spreading. Feral goats can be found in Snowdonia. [174] The waters of south-west Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks , Atlantic grey seals , leatherback turtles, dolphins , porpoises , jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, in particular, are recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins , and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins in the whole of the UK. River fish of note include char , eel , salmon , shad , sparling and Arctic char , whilst the gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake . Wales is known for its shellfish, including cockles , limpet , mussels and periwinkles . Herring , mackerel and hake are the more common of the country's marine fish. [175] The north facing high grounds of Snowdonia support a relict pre-glacial flora including the iconic Snowdon lily \u2013 Gagea serotina \u2013 and other alpine species such as Saxifraga cespitosa , Saxifraga oppositifolia and Silene acaulis . Wales has a number of plant species not found elsewhere in the UK, including the spotted rock-rose Tuberaria guttata on Anglesey and Draba aizoides on the Gower. [176] Economy Main article: Economy of Wales A profile of the economy of Wales in 2012 Over the last 250 years, Wales has been transformed first from a predominantly agricultural country to an industrial, and now a post-industrial economy . [177] [178] [179] Since the Second World War, the service sector has come to account for the majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. [180] Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2016 was \u00a359.6\u00a0billion, or \u00a319,140 per head of population; 72.7 per cent of the UK average, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. [181] In the three months to December 2017, 72.7 per cent of working-age adults were employed , compared to 75.2 per cent across the UK as a whole. [181] For the 2018\u201319 fiscal year, the Welsh fiscal deficit accounts for 19.4 percent of Wales' estimated GDP. [182] From the middle of the 19th century until the post-war era, the mining and export of coal was a dominant industry. At its peak of production in 1913, nearly 233,000 men and women were employed in the south Wales coalfield , mining 56 million tons of coal. [183] Cardiff was once the largest coal-exporting port in the world and, for a few years before the First World War, handled a greater tonnage of cargo than either London or Liverpool. [184] [185] In the 1920s, over 40% of the male Welsh population worked in heavy industry . [186] According to Professor Phil Williams , the Great Depression \"devastated Wales\", north and south, because of its \"overwhelming dependence on coal and steel\". [186] From the mid-1970s, the Welsh economy faced massive restructuring with large numbers of jobs in traditional heavy industry disappearing and being replaced eventually by new ones in light industry and in services. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wales was successful in attracting an above average share of foreign direct investment in the UK. [187] However, much of the new industry was essentially of a \"branch (or \"screwdriver\") factory\" type where a manufacturing plant or call centre is in Wales but the most highly paid jobs in the company are elsewhere. [188] [189] Poor-quality soil in much of Wales is unsuitable for crop-growing so livestock farming has traditionally been the focus of farming. About 78% of the land surface is harnessed for agriculture. [190] The Welsh landscape, with its three national parks and Blue Flag beaches , attracts large numbers of tourists , who bolster the economy of rural areas. [191] [192] Wales like Northern Ireland has relatively few high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) \u2013 Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. [189] The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK \u2013 in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. [189] In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status . [193] The pound sterling is the currency used in Wales. Numerous Welsh banks issued their own banknotes in the 19th century. The last bank to do so closed in 1908; since then, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to have the right to issue banknotes in their own countries, the Bank of England has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in Wales. [194] [195] The Commercial Bank of Wales , established in Cardiff by Sir Julian Hodge in 1971, was taken over by the Bank of Scotland in 1988 and absorbed into its parent company in 2002. [196] The Royal Mint , who issue the coinage circulated through the whole of the UK, have been based at a single site in Llantrisant since 1980. [197] Since decimalisation , in 1971, at least one of the coins in circulation emphasises Wales such as the 1995 and 2000 one Pound coin (above). As at 2012, the last designs devoted to Wales saw production in 2008. [198] Transport Main article: Transport in Wales The Second Severn Crossing The M4 motorway running from West London to South Wales links Newport , Cardiff and Swansea . Responsibility for the section of the motorway within Wales, from the Second Severn Crossing to Pont Abraham services, sits with the Welsh Government. [199] The A55 expressway has a similar role along the north Wales coast, connecting Holyhead and Bangor with Wrexham and Flintshire. It also links to northwest England, principally Chester . [200] The main north-south Wales link is the A470 , which runs from Cardiff to Llandudno . [201] The Welsh Government manages those parts of the British railway network within Wales, through the Transport for Wales Rail train operating company. [202] The Cardiff region has its own urban rail network . Beeching cuts in the 1960s mean that most of the remaining network is geared toward east-west travel connecting with the Irish Sea ports for ferries to Ireland. [203] Services between north and south Wales operate through the English towns of Chester and Shrewsbury along the Welsh Marches Line . Trains in Wales are mainly diesel-powered but the South Wales Main Line branch of the Great Western Main Line used by services from London Paddington to Cardiff is undergoing electrification , although the programme has experienced significant delays and costs-overruns. [204] [205] [206] Cardiff Airport is the international airport of Wales. Providing links to European, African and North American destinations, it is about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) southwest of Cardiff city centre , in the Vale of Glamorgan. Intra-Wales flights run between Anglesey (Valley) and Cardiff, operated since 2017 by Eastern Airways . [207] Other internal flights operate to northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. [208] Wales has four commercial ferry ports. Regular ferry services to Ireland operate from Holyhead , Pembroke Dock and Fishguard . The Swansea to Cork service was cancelled in 2006, reinstated in March 2010, and withdrawn again in 2012. [209] [210] Education Main article: Education in Wales See also: List of universities in Wales and List of further education colleges in Wales St. David's Building, Lampeter campus, University of Wales, Trinity Saint David ( Prifysgol Cymru, Y Drindod Dewi Sant ). Founded in 1822, it is the oldest degree-awarding institution in Wales. [211] A distinct education system has developed in Wales. [212] Formal education before the 18th century was the preserve of the elite. The first grammar schools were established in Welsh towns such as Ruthin , Brecon and Cowbridge. [212] One of the first successful schooling systems was started by Griffith Jones , who introduced the circulating schools in the 1730s; these are believed to have taught half the country's population to read. [213] In the 19th century, with increasing state involvement in education, Wales was forced to adopt an education system that was English in ethos even though the country was predominantly Non-conformist, Welsh-speaking and demographically uneven because of the economic expansion in the south. [213] In some schools, to ensure Welsh children spoke English at school, the Welsh Not was employed as corrective punishment; this was much resented, [214] [215] [216] although the extent of its use is difficult to determine. [217] State and local governmental edicts resulted in schooling in the English language which, following Brad y Llyfrau Gleision (the Treachery of the Blue Books), was seen as more academic and worthwhile for children. [218] The University College of Wales opened in Aberystwyth in 1872. Cardiff and Bangor followed, and the three colleges came together in 1893 to form the University of Wales . [213] The Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889 created 95 secondary schools. The Welsh Department for the Board of Education followed in 1907, which gave Wales its first significant educational devolution. [213] A resurgence in Welsh-language schools in the latter half of the 20th century at nursery and primary level saw attitudes shift towards teaching in the medium of Welsh. [219] Welsh is a compulsory subject in all of Wales' state schools for pupils aged 5\u201316 years old. [220] While there has never been an exclusively Welsh-language college, Welsh-medium higher education is delivered through the individual universities and has since 2011 been supported by the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (Welsh National College) as a delocalised federal institution. In 2018\u20132019, there were 1,494 maintained schools in Wales. [221] In 2018\u20132019, the country had 468,398 pupils taught by 23,593 full-time equivalent teachers. [222] [223] Healthcare Main articles: Healthcare in Wales and NHS Wales University Hospital of Wales , Cardiff Public healthcare in Wales is provided by NHS Wales ( GIG Cymru ), originally formed as part of the NHS structure for England and Wales by the National Health Service Act 1946 , but with powers over the NHS in Wales coming under the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969. [224] Responsibility for NHS Wales passed to the Welsh Assembly under devolution in 1999, and is now the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Social Services . [225] Historically, Wales was served by smaller 'cottage' hospitals, built as voluntary institutions. [226] As newer, more expensive, diagnostic techniques and treatments became available, clinical work has been concentrated in newer, larger district hospitals. [226] In 2006, there were seventeen district hospitals in Wales. [226] NHS Wales employs some 80,000 staff, making it Wales' biggest employer. [227] A 2009 Welsh health survey reported that 51 per cent of adults reported their health good or excellent, while 21 per cent described their health as fair or poor. [228] The survey recorded that 27 per cent of Welsh adults had a long-term chronic illness, such as arthritis, asthma, diabetes or heart disease. [225] [229] The 2018 National Survey of Wales, which enquired into health-related lifestyle choices, reported that 19 per cent of the adult population were smokers , 18 per cent admitted drinking alcohol above weekly recommended guidelines, while 53 per cent undertook the recommended 150 minutes of physical activity each week. [230] Demography Main articles: Demography of Wales and Demography of the United Kingdom Population history Year Population of Wales 1536 278,000 1620 360,000 1770 500,000 1801 587,000 1851 1,163,000 1911 2,421,000 1921 2,656,000 1939 2,487,000 1961 2,644,000 1991 2,811,865 2011 3,063,000 Estimated (pre-1801); census (post-1801) [231] [232] The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire , which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. [233] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution , as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, [234] [235] including Italians , who migrated to South Wales. [236] Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethnocultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh. [237] The population in 1972 stood at 2.74 million and remained broadly static for the rest of the decade. However, in the early 1980s, the population fell due to net migration out of Wales. Since the 1980s, net migration has generally been inward, and has contributed more to population growth than natural change . [238] The resident population of Wales in 2011 increased by 5% since 2001 to 3,063,456, of whom 1,504,228 are men and 1,559,228 women, according to the 2011 census results. Wales accounted for 4.8% of the UK population in 2011. [239] Wales has six cities. In addition to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea, the communities of Bangor , St Asaph and St Davids also have city status in the United Kingdom .

Most linguists believe that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain around 600 BCE. [243] The Brythonic languages ceased to be spoken in of England and were replaced by the English language , which arrived in Wales around the end of the eighth century due to the defeat of the Kingdom of Powys . [244] The Bible translations into Welsh and Protestant Reformation , which encouraged use of the vernacular in religious services, helped the language survive after Welsh elites abandoned it in favour of English in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. [245] Successive Welsh language acts, in 1942, 1967 , 1993 , and 2011 , have improved the legal status of Welsh. [246] Starting in the 1960s, many road signs have been replaced by bilingual versions. [247] Various public and private sector bodies have adopted bilingualism to a varying degree and (since 2011) Welsh is the only official language in any part of the United Kingdom. [248] English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the main language in most of the country. Code-switching is common in all parts of Wales and is known by various terms, though none is recognised by professional linguists. [249] \" Wenglish \" is the Welsh English language dialect. It has been influenced significantly by Welsh grammar and includes words derived from Welsh. According to John Davies, Wenglish has \"been the object of far greater prejudice than anything suffered by Welsh\". [250] [251] Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh, a decrease from the 20.8% returned in the 2001 census. [252] [253] Although monoglotism in young children continues, life-long monoglotism in Welsh no longer occurs. [254] Religion St. David's Cathedral , Pembrokeshire The largest religion in Wales is Christianity, with 57.6 per cent of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2011 census. [255] The Church in Wales with 56,000 adherents has the largest attendance of the denominations. [256] It is a province of the Anglican Communion , and was part of the Church of England until disestablishment in 1920 under the Welsh Church Act 1914 . The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth . The Presbyterian Church of Wales was born out of the Welsh Methodist revival in the 18th century and seceded from the Church of England in 1811. [257] The second largest attending faith in Wales is Roman Catholic , with an estimated 43,000 adherents. [256] The 2011 census recorded 32.1 per cent of people declaring no religion, while 7.6 per cent did not reply to the question. [255] The patron saint of Wales is Saint David ( Dewi Sant ), with Saint David's Day ( Dydd G\u0175yl Dewi Sant ) celebrated annually on 1 March. [258] In 1904, there was a religious revival (known by some as the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival , or simply The 1904 Revival) which started through the evangelism of Evan Roberts and saw large numbers of people converting to non-Anglican Christianity, sometimes whole communities. [259] Roberts' style of preaching became the blueprint for new religious bodies such as Pentecostalism and the Apostolic Church . [260] Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 2.7 per cent of the population. [255] Islam is the largest, with 24,000 (0.8 per cent) reported Muslims in the 2011 census. [255] 2 Glynrhondda Street in Cathays , Cardiff, is accepted as the first mosque in the United Kingdom [261] [262] [263] founded by Yemeni and Somali sailors on their trips between Aden and Cardiff Docks . [264] There are also communities of Hindus and Sikhs , mainly in the south Wales cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, while the largest concentration of Buddhists is in the western rural county of Ceredigion . [265] Judaism was the first non-Christian faith to be established in Wales since Roman times, though by 2001 the community had declined to approximately 2,000 [266] and as of 2019 only numbers in the hundreds.

The country has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites : The Castles and Town walls of King Edward I in Gwynedd ; Pontcysyllte Aqueduct ; and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape . [268] Mythology Main article: Welsh mythology Remnants of native Celtic mythology of the pre-Christian Britons was passed down orally by the cynfeirdd (the early poets). [269] Some of their work survives in later medieval Welsh manuscripts : the Black Book of Carmarthen and the Book of Aneirin (both 13th-century); the Book of Taliesin and the White Book of Rhydderch (both 14th-century); and the Red Book of Hergest (c.\u00a01400). [269] The prose stories from the White and Red Books are known as the Mabinogion . [270] Poems such as Cad Goddeu (The Battle of the Trees) and mnemonic list-texts like the Welsh Triads and the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain , also contain mythological material. [271] [272] [273] These texts include the earliest forms of the Arthurian legend and the traditional history of post- Roman Britain . [269] Other sources of Welsh folklore include the 9th-century Latin historical compilation Historia Britonum (the History of the Britons) and Geoffrey of Monmouth 's 12th-century Latin chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae (the History of the Kings of Britain), and later folklore, such as The Welsh Fairy Book by W. Jenkyn Thomas. [274] [275] Literature Main articles: Literature of Wales (Welsh language) , List of Welsh writers , and Literature of Wales (English language) Welsh poetry from the 13th-century Black Book of Carmarthen Wales has one of the oldest unbroken literary traditions in Europe [276] going back to the sixth century and including Geoffrey of Monmouth and Gerald of Wales , regarded as among the finest Latin authors of the Middle Ages. [276] The earliest body of Welsh verse, by poets Taliesin and Aneirin , survive not in their original form, but in , much changed, medieval versions. [276] Welsh poetry and native lore and learning survived the Dark Ages, through the era of the Poets of the Princes (c. 1100 \u2013 1280) and then the Poets of the Gentry (c. 1350 \u2013 1650). The former were professional poets who composed eulogies and elegies to their patrons while the latter favoured the cywydd metre. [277] The period produced one of Wales' greatest poets, Dafydd ap Gwilym . [278] After the Anglicisation of the gentry the tradition declined. [277] Despite the extinction of the professional poet, the integration of the native elite into a wider cultural world did bring other literary benefits. [279] Renaissance scholars such as William Salesbury and John Davies brought humanist ideals from English universities. [279] In 1588 William Morgan became the first person to translate the Bible into Welsh . [279] From the 16th century the proliferation of the 'free-metre' verse became the most important development in Welsh poetry, but from the middle of the 17th century a host of imported accentual metres from England became very popular. [279] By the 19th century the creation of a Welsh epic, fuelled by the eisteddfod, became an obsession with Welsh-language writers. [280] The output of this period was prolific in quantity but unequal in quality. [281] Initially excluded,  religious denominations came to dominate the competitions, with bardic themes becoming scriptural and didactic. [281] Developments in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest 's translation into English of the Mabinogion, one of the most important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen , credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones 's Ymadawiad Arthur . [280] The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry . [280] The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis , for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism. [280] The careers of some 1930s writers continued after World War Two, including those of Gwyn Thomas , Vernon Watkins , and Dylan Thomas , whose most famous work Under Milk Wood was first broadcast in 1954. Thomas was one of the most notable and popular Welsh writers of the 20th century and one of the most innovative poets of his time. [282] The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, with greater sympathy for Welsh nationalism and the Welsh language. The change is linked to the nationalism of Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in 1936. [283] In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the twentieth century. He \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\". [284] Major writers in the second half of the twentieth century include Emyr Humphreys (born 1919), who during his long writing career published over twenty novels, [285] and Raymond Williams (1921\u20131988). [286] Museums and libraries The National Library of Wales , Aberystwyth Amgueddfa Cymru \u2013 National Museum Wales was founded by royal charter in 1907 and is now a Welsh Government sponsored body . The National Museum is made up of seven sites across the country, including the National Museum Cardiff , St Fagans National History Museum and Big Pit National Coal Museum . In April 2001, the attractions attached to the National Museum were granted free entry by the Assembly, and this action saw the visitor numbers to the sites increase during 2001\u20132002 by 87.8 per cent to 1,430,428. [287] Aberystwyth is home to the National Library of Wales , which houses some of the most important collections in Wales, including the Sir John Williams Collection and the Shirburn Castle collection. [288] As well as its printed collection the Library holds important Welsh art collections including portraits and photographs, ephemera such as postcards, posters and Ordnance Survey maps. [288] Visual arts Main article: Welsh art See also: Architecture of Wales Works of Celtic art have been found in Wales. [289] In the Early Medieval period, the Celtic Christianity of Wales was part of the Insular art of the British Isles . A number of illuminated manuscripts from Wales survive, including the 8th-century Hereford Gospels and Lichfield Gospels . The 11th-century Ricemarch Psalter (now in Dublin ) is certainly Welsh, made in St David's , and shows a late Insular style with unusual Viking influence. [290] [291] Some Welsh artists of the 16th\u201318th centuries tended to leave the country to work, moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714\u20131782) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the popularity of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival . [292] [293] The Bard , 1774, by Thomas Jones (1742\u20131803) An Act of Parliament in 1857 provided for the establishment of a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. [294] [295] The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams , whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens [296] and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. [297] Welsh painters gravitated towards the art capitals of Europe. Augustus John and his sister Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales for most of their lives, while remaining in touch with the wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism . Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill , the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones . The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes . [298] South Wales had several notable potteries , one of the first important sites being the Ewenny Pottery in Bridgend , which began producing earthenware in the 17th century. [299] In the 18th and 19th centuries, with more scientific methods becoming available more refined ceramics were produced led by the Cambrian Pottery (1764\u20131870, also known as \"Swansea pottery\") and later Nantgarw Pottery near Cardiff, which was in operation from 1813 to 1822 making fine porcelain and then utilitarian pottery until 1920. [299] Portmeirion Pottery , founded in 1960 by Susan Williams-Ellis , daughter of Clough Williams-Ellis , creator of the Italianate village of Portmeirion , Gwynedd , is based in Stoke-on-Trent , England. [300] National symbols and anthem Main article: National symbols of Wales Prince of Wales's feathers The Flag of Wales incorporates the red dragon ( Y Ddraig Goch ) of Prince Cadwalader along with the Tudor colours of green and white. [301] It was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul's Cathedral . [301] The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. [302] On its creation the Union Jack incorporated the flags of the kingdoms of Scotland, of Ireland and the Cross of St. George which then represented the Kingdom of England and Wales. [303] \" Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau \" (English: Land of My Fathers ) is the National Anthem of Wales, and is played at events such as football or rugby matches involving the Wales national team as well as the opening of the Senedd and other official occasions. [304] [305] \"God Save the Queen\" , the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside Hen Wlad fy Nhadau during official events with a royal connection. [306] The daffodil and the leek are both symbols of Wales. The origins of the leek can be traced to the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd George . [307] This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen , and that for daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. [135] A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins. [307] The Prince of Wales' heraldic badge is also sometimes used to symbolise Wales. The badge, known as the Prince of Wales's feathers , consists of three white feathers emerging from a gold coronet. A ribbon below the coronet bears the German motto Ich dien (I serve). Several Welsh representative teams, including the Welsh rugby union, and Welsh regiments in the British Army (the Royal Welsh , for example) use the badge or a stylised version of it. There have been attempts made to curtail the use of the emblem for commercial purposes and restrict its use to those authorised by the Prince of Wales. [308] Sport Main article: Sport in Wales Millennium Stadium , Cardiff More than 50 national governing bodies regulate and organise their sports in Wales. [309] Most of those involved in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international events or fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup , Rugby World Cup , Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games . At the Olympic Games , Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team. Wales has hosted several international sporting events. [310] These include the 1958 Commonwealth Games , [311] the 1999 Rugby World Cup , the 2010 Ryder Cup and the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final . [310] [312] Although football has traditionally been the more popular sport in north Wales , rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness. [313] The Wales national rugby union team takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship and has also competed in every Rugby World Cup , hosting the tournament in 1999 . The five professional sides that replaced the traditional club sides in major competitions in 2003 were replaced in 2004 by the four regions: Cardiff Blues , Dragons , Ospreys and Scarlets . [314] [315] The Welsh regional teams play in the Pro14 , [316] the Heineken Champions Cup if they qualify [317] and the European Rugby Challenge Cup , again dependant on qualification. [318] Rugby league in Wales dates back to 1907. A professional Welsh League existed from 1908 to 1910. [319] Wales has had its own football league, the Welsh Premier League , since 1992. [320] For historical reasons, five Welsh clubs play in the English football league system ; Cardiff City , Swansea City , Newport County , Wrexham ,  and Merthyr Town . [321] Famous Welsh players over the years include John Charles , John Toshack , Gary Speed , Ian Rush , Ryan Giggs , Gareth Bale , Aaron Ramsey , and Daniel James . [322] At UEFA Euro 2016 , the Wales national team achieved their best ever finish, reaching the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Portugal. [323] In international cricket , Wales and England field a single representative team, administered by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), called the England cricket team , or simply 'England'. [324] Occasionally, a separate Wales team play limited-overs competitions. Glamorgan County Cricket Club is the only Welsh participant in the England and Wales County Championship. [325] Wales has produced several world-class participants of individual and team sports including snooker players Ray Reardon , Terry Griffiths , Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens . [326] Track athletes who have made a mark on the world stage include hurdler Colin Jackson and Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson . [327] [328] Champion cyclists include Nicole Cooke [329] and Geraint Thomas . [330] Wales has a tradition of producing world-class boxers. Joe Calzaghe was WBO world super-middleweight champion and then won the WBA, WBC and Ring Magazine super middleweight and Ring Magazine light-heavyweight titles. [331] Other former boxing world champions include Enzo Maccarinelli , Freddie Welsh , Howard Winstone , Percy Jones , Jimmy Wilde , Steve Robinson and Robbie Regan . [332] Tommy Farr , the \"Tonypandy Terror\", came close to defeating world heavyweight champion Joe Louis at the height of his fame in 1937. [333] Media Main article: Media in Wales See also: List of newspapers in Wales A number of BBC productions, such as Doctor Who and Torchwood , have been filmed in Wales. Wales became the UK's first digital television nation. [334] BBC Cymru Wales is the national broadcaster, [335] producing both television and radio programmes in Welsh and English from its base in Central Square , Cardiff. [336] The broadcaster also produces programmes such as Life on Mars , Doctor Who and Torchwood for BBC's network audience across the United Kingdom. [335] [337] ITV , the UK's main commercial broadcaster, has a Welsh-oriented service branded as ITV Cymru Wales , whose studios are in Cardiff Bay . [338] S4C, based in Carmarthen , first broadcast on 1 November 1982. Its output was mostly Welsh-language at peak hours but shared English-language content with Channel 4 at other times. Since the digital switchover in April 2010, the channel has broadcast exclusively in Welsh. [339] BBC Radio Cymru is the BBC's Welsh-language radio service, broadcasting throughout Wales. [335] A number of independent radio stations broadcast to the Welsh regions, predominantly in English. In 2006 several regional radio stations were broadcasting in Welsh: output ranged from two, two-minute news bulletins each weekday ( Radio Maldwyn ), through to over 14 hours of Welsh-language programmes weekly ( Swansea Sound ), to essentially bilingual stations such as Heart Cymru and Radio Ceredigion . [340] Most of the newspapers sold and read in Wales are national newspapers available throughout Britain. The Western Mail is Wales' only national daily newspaper. [341] Wales-based regional daily newspapers include: Daily Post (which covers north Wales); South Wales Evening Post (Swansea); South Wales Echo (Cardiff); and South Wales Argus (Newport). [341] Y Cymro is a Welsh-language newspaper, published weekly. [342] Wales on Sunday is the only Welsh Sunday newspaper to cover the whole of Wales. [343] The Books Council of Wales (BCW) is the Welsh Government funded body tasked with promoting Welsh literature. [344] The BCW provides publishing grants for qualifying English- and Welsh-language publications. [345] Around 600\u2013650 books are published each year, by some of the dozens of Welsh publishers. [346] [347] Wales' main publishing houses include Gomer Press , Gwasg Carreg Gwalch , Honno , the University of Wales Press and Y Lolfa . [346] Cambria , a Welsh affairs magazine published bi-monthly in English, has subscribers internationally. [348] Titles published quarterly in English include Planet and Poetry Wales . [349] [350] Welsh-language magazines include the current affairs titles Golwg (View) (published weekly) and Barn (Opinion) (monthly). [342] Among the specialist magazines, Y Wawr (The Dawn) is published quarterly by Merched y Wawr , the national organisation for women. [342] Y Traethodydd (The Essayist), a quarterly publication by The Presbyterian Church of Wales , first appeared in 1845; the oldest Welsh publication still in print. [342] Cuisine Main article: Welsh cuisine Cawl , a traditional meat and vegetable dish from Wales Traditional Welsh dishes include laverbread (made from Porphyra umbilicalis , an edible seaweed ); bara brith (fruit bread); cawl (a lamb stew); cawl cennin ( leek soup ); and Welsh cakes . [351] Cockles are sometimes served as a traditional breakfast with bacon and laverbread. [352] Although Wales has its own traditional food and has absorbed much of the cuisine of England, Welsh diets now owe more to the countries of India , China and the United States . Chicken tikka masala is the country's favourite dish while hamburgers and Chinese food outsell fish and chips as a takeaway. [353] Performing arts Music Main article: Music of Wales Wales is often referred to as \"the land of song\", [354] notable for its harpists, male choirs, and solo artists. The main festival of music and poetry is the annual National Eisteddfod . The Llangollen International Eisteddfod provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform. The Welsh Folk Song Society has published a number of collections of songs and tunes. [355] Traditional instruments of Wales include telyn deires ( triple harp ), fiddle, crwth (bowed lyre), pibgorn (hornpipe) and other instruments. [356] Male voice choirs emerged in the 19th century, formed as the tenor and bass sections of chapel choirs, and embraced the popular secular hymns of the day. [357] Many of the historic choirs survive in modern Wales, singing a mixture of traditional and popular songs. [357] Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins performing in 2011 The BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally. The Welsh National Opera is based at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay , while the National Youth Orchestra of Wales was the first of its type in the world. [358] Wales has a tradition of producing notable singers, including Geraint Evans , Gwyneth Jones , Anne Evans , Margaret Price , Tom Jones , Bonnie Tyler , Bryn Terfel , Mary Hopkin , Charlotte Church , Donna Lewis , Katherine Jenkins , and Shirley Bassey . [359] Popular bands that emerged from Wales include Badfinger , [360] the Manic Street Preachers , [361] the Stereophonics and Feeder , the Super Furry Animals and Catatonia . [362] The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers such as Si\u00e2n James [363] Drama and dance See also: Cinema of Wales Anthony Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was named the number-one villain in cinema history by the AFI . [364] The earliest surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays , Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen (\"The three Kings from Cologne\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\"The Passion and the Resurrection\"). [365] A recognised Welsh tradition of theatre emerged during the 18th century, in the form of an interlude , a metrical play performed at fairs and markets. [366] Drama in the early 20th century thrived, but the country established neither a Welsh National Theatre nor a national ballet company. [367] After the Second World War the substantial number of amateur companies that had existed before the outbreak of hostilities reduced by two-thirds. [368] Competition from television in the mid-20th century led to greater professionalism in the theatre. [368] Plays by Emlyn Williams and Alun Owen and others were staged, while Welsh actors, including Richard Burton and Stanley Baker , were establishing themselves as artistic talents. [368] Anthony Hopkins is an alumnus of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama , [369] and other notable Welsh actors include Michael Sheen and Catherine Zeta-Jones . [370] Wales has also produced well known comedians including Rob Brydon , Tommy Cooper , Terry Jones , and Harry Secombe . [371] Traditional dances include folk dancing and clog dancing . The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis , but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out due to religious opposition. [367] In the 20th century a revival was led by Lois Blake (1890\u20131974). [367] Clog dancing was preserved and developed by Howel Wood (1882\u20131967) and others who perpetuated the art on local and national stages. [372] The Welsh Folk Dance Society was founded in 1949; [372] it supports a network of national amateur dance teams and publishes support material. Contemporary dance grew out of Cardiff in the 1970s; one of the earliest companies, Moving Being , came from London to Cardiff in 1973. [372] Diversions was formed in 1983, eventually becoming the National Dance Company Wales , now the resident company at the Wales Millennium Centre. [373] Festivals Wales has some unique celebratory days. An early festivity was Mabsant when local parishes would celebrate the patron saint of their local church. [374] Wales's national day is Saint David 's Day, marked on 1 March, believed to be the date of David's death in the year 589. [375] Dydd Santes Dwynwen 's day commemorates the local patron saint of friendship and love. It is celebrated on 25 January in a similar way to St Valentine's Day. [376] Calan Gaeaf , associated with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It has largely been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and G\u0175yl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day). [377] See also Wales portal Outline of Wales Y Wladfa : Welsh settlement in Argentina Explanatory notes ^ The earliest instance of Lloegyr occurs in the early 10th-century prophetic poem Armes Prydein . It seems comparatively late as a place name, the nominative plural Lloegrwys , \"men of Lloegr \", being earlier and more common. The English were sometimes referred to as an entity in early poetry ( Saeson , as today) but just as often as Eingl (Angles), Iwys (Wessex-men), etc. Lloegr and Sacson became the norm later when England emerged as a kingdom. As for its origins, some scholars have suggested that it originally referred only to Mercia \u2013 at that time a powerful kingdom and for centuries the main foe of the Welsh. It was then applied to the new kingdom of England as a whole (see for instance Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein , University of Wales Press, 1987). \"The lost land\" and other fanciful meanings, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth 's monarch Locrinus, have no etymological basis. (See also Discussion in Reference 40) ^ The title Prince of Wales is still conferred on the heir apparent to the British throne, currently Prince Charles , but he has no constitutional role in modern Wales. [106] According to the Welsh Government: \"Our Prince of Wales at the moment is Prince Charles, who is the present heir to the throne. But he does not have a role in the governance of Wales, even though his title might suggest that he does.\" [105] Citations ^ \"Cymru am byth! The meaning behind the Welsh motto\" .

The capital and main commercial and financial centre is Cardiff . Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Conwy Castle, Wales Conwy Castle, along the River Conwy, Wales. \u00a9 Tomas Marek/Dreamstime.com Britannica Quiz Traveler\u2019s Guide to Europe Where is the capital of the European Union located? Famed for its strikingly rugged landscape, the small nation of Wales\u2014which comprises six distinctive regions\u2014was one of Celtic Europe\u2019s most prominent political and cultural centres, and it retains aspects of culture that are markedly different from those of its English neighbours. Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. The medieval chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis (Gerald of Wales) had topography , history, and current events alike in mind when he observed that Wales is a \u201ccountry very strongly defended by high mountains, deep valleys, extensive woods, rivers, and marshes; insomuch that from the time the Saxons took possession of the island the remnants of the Britons, retiring into these regions, could never be entirely subdued either by the English or by the Normans.\u201d In time, however, Wales was in fact subdued and, by the Act of Union of 1536, formally joined to the kingdom of England. Welsh engineers, linguists, musicians, writers, and soldiers went on to make significant contributions to the development of the larger British Empire even as many of their compatriots laboured at home to preserve cultural traditions and even the Welsh language itself, which enjoyed a revival in the late 20th century. In 1997 the British government, with the support of the Welsh electorate, provided Wales with a measure of autonomy through the creation of the Welsh Assembly, which assumed decision-making authority for most local matters. Although Wales was shaken by the decline of its industrial mainstay, coal mining , by the end of the 20th century the country had developed a diversified economy, particularly in the cities of Cardiff and Swansea , while the countryside, once reliant on small farming, drew many retirees from England. Tourism became an economic staple, with visitors\u2014including many descendants of Welsh expatriates\u2014drawn to Wales\u2019s stately parks and castles as well as to cultural events highlighting the country\u2019s celebrated musical and literary traditions. In the face of constant change, Wales continues to seek both greater independence and a distinct place in an integrated Europe.

Subscribe today Land Wales is bounded by the Dee estuary and Liverpool Bay to the north, the Irish Sea to the west, the Severn estuary and the Bristol Channel to the south, and England to the east. Anglesey (M\u00f4n), the largest island in England and Wales, lies off the northwestern coast and is linked to the mainland by road and rail bridges. The varied coastline of Wales measures about 600 miles (970 km). The country stretches some 130 miles (210 km) from north to south, and its east-west width varies, reaching 90 miles (145 km) across in the north, narrowing to about 40 miles (65 km) in the centre, and widening again to more than 100 miles (160 km) across the southern portion. Physical features of Wales Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. Relief Glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) carved much of the Welsh landscape into deeply dissected mountains, plateaus, and hills, including the north-south\u2013trending Cambrian Mountains, a region of plateaus and hills that are themselves fragmented by rivers. Protruding from that backbone are two main mountain areas\u2014the Brecon Beacons in the south, rising to 2,906 feet (886 metres) at Pen y Fan, and Snowdonia in the northwest, reaching 3,560 feet (1,085 metres) at Snowdon , the highest mountain in Wales. Snowdonia\u2019s magnificent scenery is accentuated by stark and rugged rock formations, many of volcanic origin, whereas the Beacons generally have softer outlines. The uplands are girdled on the seaward side by a series of steep-sided coastal plateaus ranging in elevation from about 100 to 700 feet (30 to 210 metres). Many of them have been pounded by the sea into spectacular steplike cliffs. Other plateaus give way to coastal flats that are estuarine in origin. Snowdon Snowdon, northern Wales. Gdr Wales consists of six traditional regions\u2014the rugged central heartland, the North Wales lowlands and Isle of Anglesey county, the Cardigan coast (Ceredigion county), the southwestern lowlands, industrial South Wales, and the Welsh borderland. The heartland, which coincides partly with the counties Powys , Denbighshire , and Gwynedd , extends from the Brecon Beacons in the south to Snowdonia in the north and includes the two national parks based on those mountain areas. To the north and northwest lie the coastal lowlands, together with the Lleyn Peninsula (Penrhyn Ll\u0177n) in Gwynedd and the island of Anglesey. To the west of the heartland, and coinciding with the county of Ceredigion , lies the coastline of Cardigan Bay, with numerous cliffs and coves and pebble- and sand-filled beaches. Southwest of the heartland are the counties of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire . There the land rises eastward from St. David\u2019s Head, through moorlands and uplands, to 1,760 feet (536 metres) in the Preseli Hills. South Wales stretches south of the heartland on an immense but largely exhausted coalfield . To the east of the heartland, the Welsh border region with England is largely agricultural and is characterized by rolling countryside and occasional wooded hills and mountainous moorland. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales Coastline, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales. James P. Rowan Drainage The main watershed of Wales runs approximately north-south along the central highlands. The larger river valleys all originate there and broaden westward near the sea or eastward as they merge into lowland plains along the English border. The Severn and Wye , two of Britain\u2019s longest rivers, lie partly within central and eastern Wales and drain into the Bristol Channel via the Severn estuary. The main river in northern Wales is the Dee , which empties into Liverpool Bay. Among the lesser rivers and estuaries are the Clwyd and Conwy in the northeast, the Tywi in the south, and the Rheidol in the west, draining into Cardigan Bay (Bae Ceredigion). The country\u2019s natural lakes are limited in area and almost entirely glacial in origin. Several reservoirs in the central uplands supply water to South Wales and to Merseyside and the Midlands in England. Dee, River River Dee at Llangollen, Wales. Akke Monasso Wales Waterfalls in the Vale of Neath, Wales, United Kingdom. Geoff Tompkinson/GTImage.com ( A Britannica Publishing Partner ) Soils The parent rock of Wales is dominated by strata ranging from Precambrian time (more than 540 million years ago) to representatives of the Jurassic Period (about 200 million to 145 million years ago). However, glaciers during the Pleistocene blanketed most of the landscape with till (boulder clay), scraped up and carried along by the underside of the great ice sheets, so that few soils can now be directly related to their parent rock. Acidic, leached podzol soils and brown earths predominate throughout Wales.

Aberystwyth resident Joe Easton said he returned from shopping in the town to find the ground floor of his home under water. Image caption Joe Easton returned home to find the ground floor under water \"I can't think of a way to describe it - apocalyptical is probably the best way,\" he said. \"We went to Home Bargains earlier and it was just coming out of the ground.\" Image caption The ground floor of Joe Easton's home was under water He said he realised it meant his home would be flooded. \"We were moving house. We came back and most of our stuff was already gone.

Concurrently the rating agency has assigned a Ba3 rating to the GBP250 million Super Senior Revolving Credit Facilities (SSRCF) of Stonegate Pub Company Bidco Limited (Bidco), a B3 rating to the Senior Secured Notes totalling GBP1,900 million in the name of the company's subsidiary, Stonegate Pub Company Financing 2019 plc (Finco), and a Caa2 rating to Bidco's GBP400 million Second Lien Facility. Moody's changed the company's rating outlook to stable from developing and assigned stable outlooks to Bidco and Finco. A full list of affected ratings is provided at the end of this press release. RATINGS RATIONALE Today's rating action follows the launch of publicly listed senior secured notes totalling GBP1,400 million which will refinance the remaining bridge facilities used by Bidco to fund Stonegate's acquisition of Ei Group plc (EiG), which completed on 3 March 2020. The prospects for the company's credit quality were particularly uncertain in the wake of the rapid spread of the Coronavirus which led to a government requirement for all pubs in the UK to be closed from 20 March. Re-openings began in England on 4 July and this brings the prospect of a gradual improvement in Stonegate's profitability and cash generation. However, during the forced closure period the company endured a significant cash burn, even after taking mitigating actions such as furloughing staff and deferring all non-essential expenditure, including rent payments. As at 3 July the company had a cash balance of GBP96 million, down from GBP229 million on 30 March (in each case excluding cash within the ringfenced Unique Pubs perimeter). On both dates the company also had drawings of GBP175 million under its SSRCF, which in more normal times would have been undrawn. On the basis of pre-crisis pro-forma results for the twelve months to January 2020 and the debt quantum immediately post-close of the acquisition, the company's Moody's-adjusted leverage, measured as Moody's-adjusted debt to EBITDA, would have been high at more than 7.5x. Without the intervention of the Coronavirus crisis, Moody's believes that prospects for deleveraging would have been good, helped by expectations of continued solid underlying performance and GBP80 million of planned synergies. However, the length of time that it takes for the number of pub-goers to return to pre-crisis levels is uncertain and until that happens the company's ability to generate historic levels of earnings will be constrained. In its base case Moody's expects it will take until mid-way through 2022 before earnings growth results in Stonegate deleveraging to below 8.0x, albeit the rating agency highlights there are numerous factors that mean the pace of recovery could be slower or faster than in its base case. More positively, Moody's believes that the company's liquidity will remain adequate over the next 12-18 months. This assessment factors in the recent additional equity injection of GBP50 million and an equivalent increase in the level of the SSRCF, to GBP250 million from GBP200 million. Furthermore, the rating agency expects that Stonegate will take a prudent and measured approach towards capital spending, notably in respect of sites earmarked for conversion from leased and tenanted to the managed format. In addition, the rating agency's current expectation is that the company's shareholders would provide additional support to liquidity in the event that a second wave of the Coronavirus negatively affected Stonegate's operations. In addition to the risks already mentioned Stonegate's B3 CFR takes account of (a) the continuing competitive industry dynamics and the company's exposure to economic conditions in a single jurisdiction; (b) a highly leveraged capital structure which along with expansionary capital spending constrains free cash flow (FCF); and (c) execution risks around the scale of the EiG acquisition in particular in respect of planned synergies, notwithstanding the strong track record of Stonegate's management over an extended period. Story continues The CFR also takes due consideration of (a) the company's strong business profile which benefits from significant scale, wide geographic spread across the UK, and a mix between managed and tenanted pubs, with all of these attributes enhanced following the EiG acquisition; (b) a history of strong revenue and profit growth for Stonegate and solid pre-acquisition performance by EiG; and (c) significant scope for synergies to drive further earnings growth for the enlarged business. ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS Moody's regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety. Stonegate is controlled by the private equity firm TDR Capital, which in common with other financial sponsors typically has tolerance for relatively high leverage in the companies it controls. However, more positively the rating agency expects TDR will continue to counter-balance this with a desire to ensure that Stonegate's capital structure is sustainable over the medium term. RATIONALE FOR STABLE OUTLOOK The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectations that Stonegate will maintain adequate liquidity over the next 12-18 months, with additional support from its shareholders if necessary. The outlook also assumes Stonegate will be able to achieve a gradual return towards pre-crisis revenue levels, which will facilitate some deleveraging as profitability also increases. FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS Although unlikely in the short to medium term, an upgrade could be considered if in operating conditions akin to the pre-crisis environment Stonegate is expected to achieve a sustained improvement in interest coverage to above 1.5x and leverage sustainably below 7.0x, combined with positive FCF and good liquidity. Conversely, a downgrade would be likely if the company's liquidity weakens or could be appropriate in the event of material delays in the return to pre-crisis operating conditions that bring into question the sustainability of the capital structure. Quantitively, a lack of progress in the next 12-18 months towards leverage improving to below 8.0x and interest coverage returning to above 1.0x would lead to negative rating pressure. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS All of the rated facilities are secured by a collateral package which includes share pledges, guarantees and debentures from Stonegate's material subsidiaries, with the exclusion of companies within the Unique Pubs sub-grouping, whose assets and cash flows are used to secure and service its ring-fenced bankruptcy remote securitisation facilities. An inter-creditor agreement regulates the relationship between the rated facilities. In its loss given default analysis Moody's has used a 50% recovery rate assumption, standard for capital structures which include a mix of bonds and loans. As such, the B3-PD PDR is in line with the CFR. The priority ranking of the SSRCF drives its Ba3 rating, three notches above the CFR and PDR. The Senior Secured Notes are rated B3, in line with the CFR, because the subordination cushion provided by ranking ahead of the Second Lien Facility is offset by the priority claims of the SSRCF in the event of a default. The Caa2 rating of the Second Lien Facility reflects its position at the bottom of the priority waterfall. LIST OF AFFECTED RATINGS: ..Issuer: Stonegate Pub Company Limited Affirmations: ....

Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology. CORPORATE PROFILE Stonegate is controlled by the private equity firm TDR Capital. Before the acquisition of EiG the company had grown via a number of acquisitions to become the largest privately held managed pub company in the UK, with more than 750 pubs under management. Separately with an estate of over 4,000 EiG was the largest leased and tenanted pub operator in the country, quoted on the London Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of around GBP0.9 billion prior to Stonegate launching its successful GBP1.3 billion equity bid last summer. The enlarged group had pro-forma reported underlying EBITDA (before IFRS 16) of GBP405 million in the twelve months to January 2020, approximately 65% of which was generated by EiG and its subsidiaries.

Senior members of the clergy including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said that while vulnerable people were \u201cpaying the price\u201d of an underfunded and unprepared NHS, \u201csome large corporations continue to avoid responsibility, making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens\u201d. They urged the UK government to follow the lead of Denmark, Poland and France in refusing to provide state support to companies registered in tax havens. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, was challenged in the House of Commons on Monday by the Labour MP Peter Kyle about what the government planned to do about companies that had \u201cso aggressively avoided paying tax in this country\u201d. \u201cMany of those same companies are now relying on the largesse and generosity of taxpayers in order to remain solvent in these difficult times,\u201d said Kyle, who sits on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee. \u201cAs the chancellor starts to plan for the recovery economy, will he take this opportunity to have conversations with those companies to make sure that when we do recover they play a much fuller part in our economy going forward? Let\u2019s aim for not business as normal when we get back from this crisis, let\u2019s aim for business as better.\u201d Sunak said it was important that businesses act responsibly, but he did not set out any plans to bar tax-avoiding firms from state bailouts or the furlough scheme. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is right that during this process people act responsibly, and that is something I have urged all businesses to do.\u201d A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cThe aim of all our schemes is to support individuals and companies in the UK, and that is what they are doing, with millions benefiting from our grants, loans and the furloughing scheme. \u201cHMRC has robust tools to challenge businesses who avoid paying their fair share of tax.

Listen to my Danish colleague @jacobmark_sf here. #covid19 pic.twitter.com/XrGdtDQ3Dc April 22, 2020 A tax-haven-based pub and restaurant chain has taken advantage of the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme to furlough 16,500 staff. Stonegate, which is registered at PO Box 2681, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands , owns the chains Slug & Lettuce, Yates and Walkabout. A spokesperson for Stonegate Pub Company said: \u201cStonegate is a UK business, located in Luton, which pays its entire tax obligations in the UK including corporation tax, employee tax and VAT. Last year Stonegate paid over \u00a3300m in tax in the UK. As a UK business, fully paying UK tax, we have every right to access government assistance such as the furloughing support for our employees whilst our pubs are unable to trade due to Covid.\u201d The church leaders said in their letter published in the Times : \u201cDuring this crisis many of the most vulnerable people in our society are paying the price for a health and welfare system woefully unprepared for an epidemic. Meanwhile, some large corporations continue to avoid responsibility, making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens. \u201cMore than 80% of the British public believe that legal tax avoidance is morally wrong. This crisis demonstrates why they are right. Today at least $8tn [\u00a36.4tn] sits offshore, with its wealthy owners hiding from their tax and social responsibilities. Developing countries are deprived of up to $400bn every year by tax dodging.\u201d The letter was organised by the Church Action for Tax Justice campaign group and was signed by the Rev Dr Barbara Glasson, president of the Methodist Conference, the Rev David Mayne, moderator of the Baptist Union Council, and representatives from the United Reformed Church and Quaker movement. John McDonnell MP (@johnmcdonnellMP) We can start reshaping the post crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they they are ending this practice. #SayNotoTaxDodgers https://t.co/jnPgrKKr6k April 24, 2020 John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said: \u201cWe can start reshaping the post-crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they are ending this practice.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has barred all companies registered in tax havens from applying for support from his country\u2019s \u20ac110bn (\u00a396bn) rescue package. \u201cIf your head office is located in a tax haven, it is obvious that you cannot benefit from public support,\u201d he said. Rune Lund, a Danish MP and Denmark\u2019s parliamentary tax spokesman, said: \u201cWhen we spend billions of taxpayers\u2019 money on saving companies and jobs, they need to go to that purpose and not get sent to a tax haven on the other side of the world.\u201d Sir Richard Branson\u2019s plea for the government to lend his Virgin Atlantic airline \u00a3500m has attracted considerable public and political criticism because he lives in the tax-free British Virgin Islands and has not paid personal UK taxes in 14 years. Branson is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person, with an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune . The letter does not name Virgin Atlantic or Branson, who owns 51% of the airline via his Virgin Group company. Virgin Atlantic is registered in the UK, but Branson\u2019s personal holding company, Virgin Group Holdings Ltd, is registered in the British Virgin Islands where there are no taxes. A spokesman for Branson declined to comment on the letter.

Learn more about Guardian Labs content Guardian Labs All together Face masks, hand sanitiser and table bookings: how a pub chain and salon embraced the 'new normal' Paid for by From hairdressers to pubs, reopening as lockdown eased required some clever adjustments. Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they\u2019re keeping staff and customers safe Jenny Stallard Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Melissa Timperley worked hard to make sure her salon still has a luxury feel while adhering to current guidelines.\nPhotograph: Shaw and Shaw/Guardian Melissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a \u201ctreat\u201d destination, she knows that everything \u2013 from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer\u2019s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee \u2013 makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience. And that isn\u2019t changing just because of lockdown rules \u2013 in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the \u201cnew normal\u201d. Based in Manchester, Timperley\u2019s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen. \u201cI think salon owners have two really important jobs,\u201d says Timperley. \u201cThey have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they\u2019ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.\u201d Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. \u201cThe whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,\u201d says Timperley. Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel. For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors. There\u2019s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that\u2019s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to show that you\u2019re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve staggered the appointments, we\u2019re opening longer hours and we\u2019re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who\u2019ve waited for us.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest Staff in the salon are wearing visors. Photograph: Shaw and Shaw/Guardian When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around. Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no \u201csharing\u201d of clients, but at other salons that\u2019s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley\u2019s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance. It\u2019s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country \u2013 wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too \u2013 all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government. For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company \u2013 which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others \u2013 opening up has also been a \u201cone day at a time\u201d process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen. Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust \u201cclosedown\u201d manual. \u201cWe\u2019ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I\u2019m glad we did as we\u2019ve had to activate that in Leicester,\u201d she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK\u2019s first local lockdown on 30 June. The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. \u201cWe communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we\u2019ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He\u2019s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what\u2019s going on. \u201cWe\u2019ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,\u201d explains Charlesworth. 'I'm so happy to be back': how Grind coffee is welcoming back its customers Read more Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. \u201cHundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you\u2019re off and we kept that updated,\u201d adds Charlesworth. Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business. And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G&T will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it\u2019s easier because then we\u2019re capturing customer data at the booking point,\u201d says Charlesworth. \u201cIf you come to the pub and you haven\u2019t booked, you\u2019ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,\u201d she says. \u201cThe wonderful thing about hospitality, it\u2019s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it\u2019s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it\u2019s like walking into the unknown.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Stonegate pub company is using a combination of screens, PPE, back-to-back tables and social distancing to adhere to the new lockdown rules. Photograph: Stocksy Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate\u2019s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,\u201d she explains. The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds. \u201cWhere it\u2019s outside we\u2019ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it\u2019s inside we\u2019ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We\u2019ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We\u2019ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we\u2019ve done.\u201d Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they\u2019re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings. Timperley says: \u201cEverything that we\u2019ve had to do differently, we\u2019ve done better. For example, the disposable towels are the nicest I could get, and the gowns are scented with vanilla. We\u2019ve tried to keep the luxury touches and as soon as we can introduce more back in, even if we can do a coffee in a disposable cup, that would make it feel nicer again. But I think people will just be so grateful to have their hair done, you know ... what I think has happened is people have tried cutting their hair at home and colouring their hair at home, and they realise how talented hairdressers are! \u201cI think the biggest challenge has been remaining positive in lockdown when everything around you is negative. For me, keeping the staff upbeat and the clients informed. Everything has been extra work.\u201d This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

A spokesperson for Stonegate Pub Company said: \u201cStonegate is a UK business, located in Luton, which pays its entire tax obligations in the UK including corporation tax, employee tax and VAT. Last year Stonegate paid over \u00a3300m in tax in the UK. As a UK business, fully paying UK tax, we have every right to access government assistance such as the furloughing support for our employees whilst our pubs are unable to trade due to Covid.\u201d The church leaders said in their letter published in the Times : \u201cDuring this crisis many of the most vulnerable people in our society are paying the price for a health and welfare system woefully unprepared for an epidemic. Meanwhile, some large corporations continue to avoid responsibility, making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens. \u201cMore than 80% of the British public believe that legal tax avoidance is morally wrong. This crisis demonstrates why they are right. Today at least $8tn [\u00a36.4tn] sits offshore, with its wealthy owners hiding from their tax and social responsibilities. Developing countries are deprived of up to $400bn every year by tax dodging.\u201d The letter was organised by the Church Action for Tax Justice campaign group and was signed by the Rev Dr Barbara Glasson, president of the Methodist Conference, the Rev David Mayne, moderator of the Baptist Union Council, and representatives from the United Reformed Church and Quaker movement. John McDonnell MP (@johnmcdonnellMP) We can start reshaping the post crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they they are ending this practice. #SayNotoTaxDodgers https://t.co/jnPgrKKr6k April 24, 2020 John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said: \u201cWe can start reshaping the post-crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they are ending this practice.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has barred all companies registered in tax havens from applying for support from his country\u2019s \u20ac110bn (\u00a396bn) rescue package. \u201cIf your head office is located in a tax haven, it is obvious that you cannot benefit from public support,\u201d he said. Rune Lund, a Danish MP and Denmark\u2019s parliamentary tax spokesman, said: \u201cWhen we spend billions of taxpayers\u2019 money on saving companies and jobs, they need to go to that purpose and not get sent to a tax haven on the other side of the world.\u201d Sir Richard Branson\u2019s plea for the government to lend his Virgin Atlantic airline \u00a3500m has attracted considerable public and political criticism because he lives in the tax-free British Virgin Islands and has not paid personal UK taxes in 14 years. Branson is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person, with an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune . The letter does not name Virgin Atlantic or Branson, who owns 51% of the airline via his Virgin Group company. Virgin Atlantic is registered in the UK, but Branson\u2019s personal holding company, Virgin Group Holdings Ltd, is registered in the British Virgin Islands where there are no taxes. A spokesman for Branson declined to comment on the letter.
