The index, which measures the currency's performance against a basket of six major peers, fell as low as 93.48 on July 27, down 1% from its July 24 close and its first dip below 94 since September 2018. It was the index's lowest point since June 2018. The currency's path downward is expected to continue. \"The bar for any reversal in the dollar decline seems to be set rather high,\" Chris Turner, global head of markets with ING, wrote in a July 27 note. \"The market is grappling with a U.S. dollar that is breaking down amidst rising concerns that the economic recovery is flattening out at ... new, lower levels of overall economic activity,\" Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist with JonesTrading, wrote in an email. A prolonged period of economic underperformance would all but guarantee continued Fed interest rates near zero, putting downward pressure on the dollar. Uncertainty around the path of U.S. stimulus efforts is \"reinforcing the negative sentiment for the dollar\" as disagreement within Congress and from the Trump administration undermines the prospects for a recovery in economic activity, said Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG Bank. \"The U.S. dollar is likely to remain under selling pressure until we have greater clarity on the policy support front,\" Halpenny wrote in a July 27 note. Congressional Republicans plan to unveil a $1 trillion economic recovery package later July 27, and it is expected to include additional $200-per-week payments for jobless Americans, down from the $600 payments set to expire at the end of July, according to The New York Times . The package is seen as a starting point for negotiations with Democrats, who passed a $3 trillion package in the House in May. Even if agreed to by Democrats, the proposed stimulus package may do little to boost the U.S. dollar since it \"won't be nearly as powerful\" as previous packages, O'Rourke said. Geopolitical tensions, primarily between the U.S. and China, are also weighing on the dollar, Turner with ING wrote. In a July 27 note, Goldman Sachs currency strategists forecast the trade-weighted U.S. dollar to weaken by an additional 5.3% over the next 12 months as the dollar is negatively correlated with the health of the global economy, which continues to improve outside the U.S. The trade-weighted U.S. dollar has fallen 4% since mid-May. \"Despite the recent selloff, the team believes the greenback remains overvalued by most metrics and offers poor fundamentals,\" David Kostin, Goldman's chief equity strategist, wrote in the note. Kostin wrote that the weakening dollar may be a catalyst for foreign investor demand for U.S. stocks. Over the past 40 years, an annual average of $96 billion in U.S. equities have been purchased by foreign investor during periods when the trade-weighted U.S. dollar fell by more than 2%, according to a Goldman analysis. Only $14 billion in U.S. equities were purchased by foreign investors while the U.S. dollar rose by more than 2%, according to the analysis.

In Europe, many governments have also imposed nationwide lockdown measures restricting business operations, gatherings and social contact, disrupting the lives of hundreds of millions of people and the operations of thousands of businesses. While some European countries are still struggling with the pandemic, some other European countries have already relaxed or announced plans to relax some of the restrictions. In this blog, we would like to compare the most recent trade credit activity and payment behavior of SMEs in eight European countries, aiming to assess the similarities and differences of the impact of COVID-19 among European SMEs. Research Data We extracted 1.4 million companies from our Trade Payment Database for eight European countries: Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Outstanding trade credit balances at month end are reported by creditors (i.e., suppliers) and are aggregated for each debtor (i.e. customers). As displayed in Figure 1, the majority of the companies are SMEs with less than 250 employees. Figure 1: Distribution of companies by the number of employees Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, June 5, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Are companies able to obtain sufficient trade credits? The use of trade credit is driven by both the supply and demand side. On the demand side, the trade credits are positively correlated to the customers\u2019 business activities and the demand for production goods. On the supply side, the trade credits are negatively correlated to suppliers\u2019 risk aversion. By looking at the amount of trade credits obtained by companies, we can estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. In Figure 2, we show the monthly aggregated outstanding trade credit balances per country. January\u2019s values are used as the pre-COVID-19 benchmark. This is because COVID-19 was first flagged to the World Health Organization by China on New Year\u2019s Eve [2] , and several Chinese cities went into lockdown in late January, causing severe disruption to the global supply chain. In February, when the number of COVID-19 cases was still lower in Europe and the majority of businesses still operated as usual, the impact of the virus had already reached the United Kingdom. The largest contribution to this drop is in the Metals and Mining sector. It is not surprising as the United Kingdom\u2019s major export to China is precious metal. When the virus started spreading uncontrollably throughout Europe in March, Italy was the hardest hit as indicated by the largest drop in trade credit balance from February, which was impacted mainly by the slowdown of business in the Wholesale and Retail sector. Entering into April, all European countries were under different degrees of lockdown/social distancing measures. Trade credit balances decreased for all these countries. When the pandemic started to be brought under control in May, we observed two opposite patterns for trade credit balances: a rebound for Belgium, Ireland and Italy; and a further drop for the remaining countries, which is especially noticeable for France and Sweden. Figure 2: Monthly outstanding trade credit balances (2020 January level = 100) Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, June 5, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Are companies paying their trade credits on time? We analyze the time series of trade credit balances and deduce the payment behavior in each month. In Figure 3, we illustrate the percentage of trade credit balances being paid on time in each country. When individual countries decided to lock down their cities in March, companies in Belgium, France and Ireland were seriously hit. The percentage of on-time payments was 32%, 23% and 16%; lower than February\u2019s values. However, we see a significant rebound for these three countries in April. The payment behavior in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom remained stable during the pandemic. We observe a small drop for the Netherlands in February, the United Kingdom in March and Sweden in April, but they were followed by an immediate rebound in the following month. The observed rebound pattern of the on-time payment across different European countries may indicate the success in providing emergency liquidity to the impacted businesses by the corresponding government. Figure 3: Monthly average percentage of trade credit balances being paid on time Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, June 5, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. We also use our proprietary statistical model, trained on historical payment data, to produce a likely scenario on the payment behavior in June (i.e. green diagonal-shaded bars in Figure 3). The model predicts a slight deterioration for Italy, a moderate deterioration for Germany, France, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and a significant deterioration for Belgium and the Netherlands, using the payment behavior from the most recent months and the historical month-over-month correlation of payment behavior. Summary There is no doubt the pandemic has slowed down business activity in the eight European countries we analyzed. From trade credit data, we see the impact of COVID-19 reached these European countries at different points in time and at different levels of severity. In June, we even observe a recovery in trade credit for Belgium and Italy. The latest increase in trade credit balance in Italy could be linked to the end of the stricter lockdown measures in the country, since the middle of May. Further data for the following month may confirm the recovery trend, keeping in mind that trade credit balances are highly seasonal and will likely remain quite volatile during these uncertain periods. With regards to the payment behavior of companies, the percentage balance of trade credit being paid on time in May is similar to the pre-COVID-19 level. Although some of these countries experienced a drop in on-time payments in March or April, it was followed by a rebound in the next month. Our proprietary model predicts different levels of deterioration in payment behavior across these countries. Governments in Europe have launched significant measures, ranging from tax deferrals to access to finance and grants, to help business struggling through the pandemic. It is likely that the governments will continue to ramp up their support measures.

Two hours later, a handful of Wetherspoons pubs will be among the first in the country to pour pints for anyone nursing a thirst at such an early hour. \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d, as it has been called, offers a rare glimmer of hope for an industry that has been staring into the abyss since the coronavirus pandemic hit. Of England\u2019s 37,500 pubs, about 28,000 are capable of opening under a physical distancing requirement of 1 metre, according to the British Beer and Pubs Association. About 60%, or 22,000, are planning to do so from this week, bringing an end to three-and-a-half long, dry months. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Physical distancing measures in place at BrewDog Tower Hill , London. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images Yet the mood is not entirely merry. Nerves are jangling in the publican fraternity, as cautious optimism is tempered by anxiety about what lies in store for the next 24 hours and beyond. \u201cPeople are frightened of opening tomorrow,\u201d says Dave Mountford, landlord of the Boat In at Cromford, Derbyshire, and long-time pubs campaigner. \u201cThey\u2019re being forced into it because they can\u2019t afford not to.\u201d Protective measures are already in place, such as staff wearing \u201cbeer goggles\u201d and traffic light systems at the toilets . Yet the remaining pitfalls are legion, from marauding drinkers causing trouble to shortages of beer, food and even security staff. Facebook Twitter Pinterest It\u2019s been a long, dry three-and-a-half months for pubs. Photograph: Simon Newman/Reuters At the top of the list of concerns is the capricious local interpretation of government guidelines. Experts fear overzealous police and council officials will attempt to shut down pubs on spurious grounds. Sarah Clover of Kings Chambers, a leading barrister on licensing law, says: \u201cEnforcers often do not understand the difference between guidance and law. \u201cThe first licensees who put their head above the parapet are going to be descended upon by an army of agencies looking to see if they\u2019re doing it wrong. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get people telling retailers like Primark they\u2019d close them down because they don\u2019t have the power to do that, but they do with licensees. \u201cThey [publicans] are very nervous that enforcers are going to do this because they can and, in my opinion, some of them will. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Physical distancing measures in place at booths and banquettes at BrewDog Tower Hill in London. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images \u201cYou\u2019ll have rogue licensees and rogue enforcers and it\u2019s a toxic mix that we\u2019ll see played out big time over the weekend.\u201d Part of the problem, says Clover, is that the guidelines are ambiguous. For instance, they suggest playing music and live sports quietly so that people don\u2019t shout over the noise, increasing the risk of spreading the virus. At local level, says Clover, some police services have erroneously told publicans that they\u2019re not allowed to show football. Liz Hind, landlady of the Old Millwrights Arms in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is delaying her reopening for 24 hours, preferring to wait for the more sedate Sunday dog-walkers\u2019 crowd. But even she fears the tap on the shoulder from police, licensing officers or environmental health. \u201cWe asked for information three weeks ago but we only got the government guidelines 10 days ago,\u201d she says. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Most bars will operate a non-cash payment system. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to interpret them but who knows if it will be good enough. \u201cWe know they\u2019ve got the power to come in and just close us down and we are expecting that they\u2019ll use that in some cases, even though we\u2019re all just trying to do our best in really difficult circumstances.\u201d Such trepidation is echoed across the industry but some fear more fundamental obstacles, such as shortages of beer and food. \u201cA lot of brewers only started brewing last week and certain products take a few weeks to brew,\u201d says Joanne Cox-Brown, director of Night Time Economy Solutions. \u201cThere could be similar issues on food, too.\u201d In some areas, bouncers are said to be in short supply, a headache given the potentially heady mix of constrained capacity with nearly four months of pent-up rowdiness . \u201cWe\u2019re seeing security staff who aren\u2019t keen on coming back after working in retail or other industries, where they\u2019re paid the same money for more regular hours,\u201d says Cox-Brown. The prevailing mood in the pubs trade is that Saturday was a bad choice for unleashing England\u2019s pubgoers. Facebook Twitter Pinterest James McAlister, manager at the Morning Star Bar and Restaurant in Belfast, who said it had been a great feeling to reopen the doors on Friday morning following lockdown. Photograph: Rebecca Black/PA Indeed, some of the UK\u2019s biggest pub companies have taken a wait-and-see approach. Greene King won\u2019t be opening any of its 1,700 pubs on Saturday, waiting instead for the rather calmer Monday trade. London-based Young\u2019s isn\u2019t serving until later in July and Fuller\u2019s is only opening 27 out of 215 this weekend, phasing them in after that. But the flip side of anxiety about overcrowding on Saturday night is the concern that not enough people will return to make pubs viable. Of 25,000 people surveyed by FindOutNow, 93% plan to give \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d a miss. But according to a survey by the Royal Society for Public Health, almost half of people plan to stay away well beyond that, for at least three months. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk That\u2019s why it\u2019s so crucial for pubs that nothing goes seriously wrong this weekend that could imperil their longer-term survival by deterring customers or triggering renewed restrictions. Stosie Madi, who will open the Parkers Arms near Clitheroe in Lancashire from Saturday, says: \u201cI\u2019ve reopened bars in West Africa after coups d\u2019etat but nothing has been as challenging as this pandemic situation. \u201cIt\u2019s a path we\u2019re beating for people opening the following week.

The Johnnie Walker whisky maker took the 1.3 billion pound non-cash writedown related to its businesses in India, Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Windsor whisky brand in South Korea, blaming challenging trading conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On Tuesday, the company reported an 8.4% drop in organic sales for the year ended June 30, larger than the 7.3% fall analysts had expected, company supplied estimates showed. This marks the company's worst annual sales performance in more than a decade, according to Bernstein analysts. Diageo shares were down 6.2% in early trading and was the biggest loser on the FTSE <.FTSE>. The stock is down nearly 10% this year, better than the FTSE's 20% decline over the same period. By region, organic sales in Asia fell the most, dropping 16% due to the impact of coronavirus-related closures of alcohol outlets and bars in India and Thailand, while in China demand was hit by the absence of the Chinese New Year. The company's Latin America, Africa and Europe and Turkey markets also posted double-digit falls in sales, mainly due to disruptions to supply chains and fewer social occasions due to the pandemic. North America was the only bright spot, with sales rising 2%, reflecting strong demand for tequilas and ready-to-drink beverages at supermarkets and alcohol stores, the company said. Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said the strong results in North America, its biggest market by revenue, was because 80% of Diageo's sales came from retail stores, in contrast to other markets, where bars and restaurants make up most of the sales. The company, which also makes Tanqueray Gin, Smirnoff Vodka and a wide range of scotch whiskey, said it was still unable to provide specific outlook for the year, after abandoning a full-year forecast in April. Its 4.5 billion pound capital returns programme remains suspended. \"The hit to earnings should be short lived provided the global economy doesn't take too long to recover,\" William Ryder, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said. \"We think the group will continue to do well long term, but management will have to focus more on debt reduction than they probably would have liked.\" The company also said it would keep paying a dividend, which Liberum analyst Nico Von Stackelberg called a \"positive sign\". After a tough second half of the year \"we should see sequential improvements (in the business) from here,\" he said in a note. Diageo's business outlook was in contrast to French spirits makers Pernod Ricard <PERP.PA> and Remy Cointreau <RCOP.PA> , which last month said the pandemic would not hit their full-year forecasts as strongly as initially feared. Diageo's impairment charge follows those of other alcoholic beverage makers, AB InBev <ABI.BR> and Heineken <HEIN.AS>. While AB Inbev took a $2.5 billion writedown related to its African operations last week, Heineken announced a nearly 550 million euro writedown on Monday.

The S&P 500 rose 1.76% for the week ending July 10 to close at 3,185.04, while the SNL U.S. Insurance Index declined 0.45% to 993.42. Stocks gained steam on the final trading day of the week after Gilead Sciences Inc. announced that its remdesivir treatment seems to reduce the risk of death for COVID-19 patients. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said the increase in coronavirus cases has raised fears for insurers, particularly those in P&C lines, about the prospect of a longer economic crisis that could include new lockdown orders. \"If we end up going into another lockdown, what does this mean for auto insurance usage?\" Seifert said in an interview, adding that insurers might have to consider further premium credits should driving decrease again from another aggressive lockdown. \"There are certain regions that are just out of control, so I think that casts a pall over almost anything else that's going on,\" she said. A majority of states reported a rise in positive tests this week, and total cases in the U.S. topped the 3 million mark. Several states have slowed down their reopening plans, while harder-hit ones like Arizona, California, Florida and Texas have shut down or limited certain areas of commerce, such as bars or indoor dining. Seifert also said the insurance market was moved by a pair of M&A deals announced this week: Allstate Corp.'s pending acquisition of National General Holdings Corp. for approximately $4 billion cash, and KKR & Co. Inc. agreeing to buy Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd., also for around $4 billion. Seifert said the deals, particularly Allstate's, have \"lit a bit of a fire\" under the smaller insurers in the market, fueling hopes that other companies will do the same. National General's share price rose sharply, soaring 61.87%, while Allstate was one of the week's biggest decliners, falling 7.57%. The deal, Seifert said, may have given Allstate \"a little bit of a bump\" in market share and increased exposure to the independent agent market, but investors would have preferred something more like buying a specialty or supplemental insurer. \"Instead, they sort of ... went back to the drawing board and paid up to get a 1% increase in market share,\" she said. Seifert in a note maintained her \"buy\" rating and target price of $118 on Allstate, saying that the auto insurance market will further consolidate \"with Allstate at the top of that pyramid.\" The rally on July 10 helped some P&C insurers finish higher for the week, including Cincinnati Financial Corp., up 8.65%; Kemper Corp., up 6.73%; and Chubb Ltd., up 2.28%.

Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP Bar Refaeli is to serve nine months of community service. Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP Oliver Holmes Jerusalem correspondent Published on Mon 20 Jul 2020 15.13 BST An Israeli court has convicted one of the world\u2019s most famous models, Bar Refaeli, on tax evasion charges, and jailed her mother, in a verdict that ends a lengthy case against the celebrity and her family. Wearing a face mask in line with coronavirus regulations, Refaeli and her mother, Zipi, entered the Tel Aviv court to a flurry of camera flashes from photographers. The pair confessed to offences of evading taxes on income nearing $10m (\u00a37.9m). Under a plea bargain agreement made last month, Refaeli will serve nine months of community service and her mother will be sent to prison for 16 months. They were also ordered to pay a \u00a31.2m fine on top of millions of back taxes owed to the state. Refaeli\u2019s lawyers argued that the plea bargain showed she had not intentionally evaded tax. The long-running trial had gripped the Israeli public, with Refaeli at one point claiming to Israeli tax authorities that she should be exempt from paying dues because she was living in the US with her then boyfriend, Leonardo DiCaprio. She later married the Israeli billionaire Adi Ezra . The 35-year-old model and her mother were investigated for failing to report discounts on luxury goods and other perks that should have been subject to income tax. Despite being ordered to stay in Israel unless given specific approval to leave, Refaeli has maintained her status as a popular TV personality. Last year, she hosted the Eurovision song contest at a glitzy ceremony in Tel Aviv. The model was first propelled to fame when she appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimwear edition in 2009, a year prosecutors allege she underreported her tax liability. The case mostly revolved around her residency status in the following years, as she toured the world for shoots, taking dozens of flights and spending much of her time outside Israel. Refaeli attempted to prove her \u201ccentre of life\u201d for tax purposes was in the US with DiCaprio and was therefore not liable to some Israeli tax. Prosecutors rejected her claim and charged her with providing incorrect tax information, while judges found her relationship with DiCaprio did not qualify as a \u201cfamily unit\u201d, meaning she should have paid the full taxes. Among the allegations were that Refaeli did not pay rent for her apartment in Tel Aviv despite living there, paid an interior designer for his services by doing publicity for his business, and received a car from a company in return for publicity, none of which were declared. Monday\u2019s indictment said Refaeli\u2019s mother, who was also her agent, had also signed leases for her daughter under the names of other family members to obscure Refaeli\u2019s residency status. Zipi Refaeli was charged with failure to report income, avoiding paying taxes and aiding someone else in evading tax payments.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it\u2019s justified. Barco could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You\u2019d really hope so, otherwise you\u2019re paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Barco ENXTBR:BAR Price Based on Past Earnings July 22nd 2020 Keen to find out how analysts think Barco\u2019s future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start . Is There Enough Growth For Barco? Barco\u2019s P/E ratio would be typical for a company that\u2019s expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market. If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company\u2019s profits fell to the tune of 31%. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 409% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth. Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 32% per annum as estimated by the three analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 7.9% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result. With this information, we can see why Barco is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock. What We Can Learn From Barco\u2019s P/E? Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. We\u2019ve established that Barco maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn\u2019t great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It\u2019s hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances. Having said that, be aware Barco is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about. Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a P/E below 20x.

The company acquired The Better Bar Company group business in November 2014. Performance The following information was extracted from Good Spirits Hospitality Limited's half year report, released on 28 February 2020: Good Spirits Hospitality Limited (NZX: GSH) announces that its unaudited net profit after tax (NPAT) for the six months to 31 December 2019 was $292,275, compared to an unaudited net profit of $615,259 in the previous corresponding period, a decrease of $(322,984). The decrease has been driven by softer trading conditions in the first half of the year, including labour cost pressures from a rise in the minimum wage and a shortage of skilled chefs in New Zealand and the material impact of the adoption of a new Accounting Standard for Leases (IFRS16). Net revenue for the period was $14,741,294 compared to $12,503,229 for the six months to 31 December 2018, an increase of 18%. On a like for like basis, revenue increased by 3.3%. Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) before significant items was $4,136,147 compared to $2,781,428 in the six months to 31 December 2018, an increase of 48.7%. This was improved by $974,855 for the accounting policy change for leases as discussed below. Removing the positive impact of the accounting policy change EBITDA improved 13.7% when compared to the half year ended 31 December 2018. The underlying NPAT from continuing operations and before significant items (Underlying NPAT) was $558,184 in the reporting period, compared to $724,301 in the previous corresponding period. The impact on underlying NPAT of the change to accounting policy ($171,433) wholly accounted for the deterioration in underlying NPAT when compared to the half year ended 31 December 2018. There were significant items consisting of finance department restructuring and advisory costs after tax of $(265,909) in the period compared to acquisition costs after tax of $(85,931) in the previous period. Operating cash flow was $1,625,569 compared to $1,501,815 in the previous period. Disclaimer: This section is provided as general information only.

A closer look at results reported by the British drinks company for the fiscal year ended June 30 indicates that the impact was especially severe in geographic regions dominated by emerging economies. The three regions of Asia Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean account for 19%, 12% and 8% of Diageo's net sales, respectively. Diageo noted that growth in North America during the year had not been enough to offset declines in all other regions, including Europe. As a result, organic net sales for the group as a whole fell 8.4%, and organic volumes dropped 11.2%. Diageo makes Guinness beer, Johnnie Walker whiskey and Tanqueray gin, among other brands. The company's shares were down 5.4% to 2,725 pence in early afternoon trading in London. \"In Europe, around 50% of our sales are normally on-trade, and Africa is a strongly on-trade-oriented region,\" CEO Ivan Menzies said Aug. 4 on a call with analysts. \"As these two regions are our largest beer markets, the decline in our beer business looked significant during COVID-19. In aggregate, around three-quarters of Guinness sales are on-trade in the larger Guinness markets in Europe and Africa.\" On-trade refers to sales made at venues such as restaurants, hotels and bars. Menzies added that the impact of the pandemic \"was also disproportionately high for our Scotch category due to its greater exposure to emerging markets and travel retail. Together, they account for over two-thirds of our Scotch net sales prior to COVID-19.\" Alcohol producers including Diageo, Pernod Ricard SA, Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA and Heineken NV have been hit hard by the effective closure of the bulk of the global hospitality industry, as well as the massive blow that travel restrictions have had on tourism and airport-based retail. More shoppers are now buying lower-priced alcoholic drinks from grocery stores and online outlets and consuming them at home, but that increase has not been enough to offset price stagnation and falling on-premise sales. Diageo said its net sales in Africa fell 13% as growth in the first half was outweighed by the pandemic impact in the second half of the year. East Africa declined 10% with continued beer growth in Tanzania offset by lockdown closures affecting on-trade in Kenya and Uganda. Net sales in Nigeria dropped 20% with double-digit declines in beer and scotch. In South Africa, net sales plunged 25%, driven by scotch and vodka, as a result of both on-trade and off-trade closures and a difficult economic climate. The country recently imposed its second ban on alcohol sales, which companies such as AB Inbev are hoping to reverse. Diageo's net sales in Asia Pacific dropped 16%. Despite growth in the first half for the region, all markets other than Australia declined due to the impact of COVID-19. Greater China declined 7% as scotch, liqueurs and beer growth was offset by declines in Chinese white spirits. In India, net sales fell 17%, triggered by an economic slowdown, a 42-day nationwide lockdown, regulatory changes and the continuation of on-trade closures thereafter. But after the lockdown was lifted, the Indian business has seen sequential improvement from May through July. The COVID-hit to Indian sales \"doesn't change our view on India at all for the long term,\" said CFO Kathryn Mikells on the call, noting that the company's business hoped to benefit from long-term trends such as population growth and increases in per-capita income. \"And really importantly, the people in India just love whiskey. ... So I would say, over the long term, we continue to be very bold, but that's a business that's going to be good for Diageo, good for its shareholders.\" Author Gautam Naik Theme Retail & Consumer Products About Us Quality Program Contact Us Email Subscription Center Press Releases Careers Corporate Responsibility Our History Investor Relations Leadership \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Terms of Use Cookie Notice Privacy Policy Disclosures Do Not Sell My Personal Information"},

Ei Group \u2013 formerly known as Enterprise Inns and which owns a portfolio of more than 4,000 pubs \u2013 has told its managers that Covid-19 is not included in the group\u2019s policy with the insurer Zurich and has advised them to consider seeking further cover elsewhere. Industry sources indicated that it appears likely the problem could be replicated in other sectors. UK supermarkets appeal for calm as shelves empty Read more In a letter sent to publicans last week, which has been seen by the Guardian, Ei said: \u201cIt has been confirmed that Zurich is not including Covid-19 in its notifiable diseases section. As such, any business affected by Covid-19 will not be able to claim for loss of trade.\u201d The move comes after many small-business owners had thought a problem with making insurance claims for coronavirus losses had been solved. Earlier this month, the government bowed to pressure by changing its stance on insurance to declare coronavirus as a \u201cnotifiable disease\u201d \u2013 a formal classification required by many insurance policies. However, many of these existing policies cite specific diseases that businesses can claim for. As coronavirus is so new, it is not included in most of the lists. A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said : \u201cA small number of businesses may have cover in place that will specifically provide for business interruption arising from notifiable diseases. However, this type of extension is not commonly included as standard. Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks and are therefore unlikely to provide cover for the effects of global pandemics like Covid-19.\u201d Viv English, who runs the Lansdown Arms in Lewes, Sussex, said: \u201cWe have no Premier League games and maybe a 20% to 30% hit on trade. I have been paying into the policy for almost 20 years, it is compulsory for us to have it [as an Ei tenant] and it is going to let us down just when we need it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a real hit and I already know I can\u2019t pay my VAT bill. We are now paying VAT [due from] December when it was Christmas and everything was fab. We are now thinking if it is better to close down for a few months and pick up then?\u201d Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk Last week, Rishi Sunak unveiled a range of moves in his first budget that were designed to assist pubs and other small businesses where trade is likely to be hit by the virus. The chancellor said he was also making big changes to the business rates paid by pubs this year, in an effort to insulate them from the economic effects of the coronavirus . Leisure businesses with a rateable value of less than \u00a351,000 will pay no rates for the next 12 months, while the \u201cpub discount\u201d given to bars with a rateable value of up to \u00a3100,000 will increase from \u00a31,000 to \u00a35,000 this year. A spokesman for Zurich said: \u201cZurich\u2019s cover for business interruption is fully aligned with the rest of the insurance market. We will always respond whenever one of our policies is triggered and are continuing to support our customers on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Topics Ei Group Insurance industry Food & drink industry Pubs Coronavirus outbreak Services sector Rishi Sunak news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story \u2018A slap in the face\u2019: pub landlords livid at lack of support by Sunak Publicans fear for future as chancellor\u2019s proposals offer nothing for traditional locals Published: 11 Jul 2020 \u2018A slap in the face\u2019: pub landlords livid at lack of support by Sunak Pizza Express closures take hospitality job losses to 17,000 Chain could shed up to 1,100 staff and close up to 70 of its 449 UK outlets as Covid-19 compound\u2019s sector deep problems Published: 4 Aug 2020 Pizza Express closures take hospitality job losses to 17,000 Rumours and threats: what happened when Covid-19 shut our pubs When a customer in a Somerset town tested positive, two local venues found themselves in the eye of a storm Published: 11 Jul 2020 Rumours and threats: what happened when Covid-19 shut our pubs Pizza Hut considers insolvency as Covid-19 crisis threatens jobs Restaurant chain, with 5,700 staff, still hopeful of reopening most of its 244 UK branches Published: 29 Jul 2020 Pizza Hut considers insolvency as Covid-19 crisis threatens jobs Greggs weighs up job cuts when furlough scheme ends Published: 28 Jul 2020 Greggs weighs up job cuts when furlough scheme ends Welsh restaurants and pubs could reopen indoors from August Published: 10 Jul 2020 Welsh restaurants and pubs could reopen indoors from August UK set to bring in strict new junk food rules including pre-9pm ad ban Published: 23 Jul 2020 UK set to bring in strict new junk food rules including pre-9pm ad ban Pubs and restaurants in England trade at half their pre-virus levels Published: 10 Jul 2020 Pubs and restaurants in England trade at half their pre-virus levels More more on this story Most popular Business Economics Banking Money Markets Project Syndicate B2B Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Natural gas fuel specialist Clean Energy Fuels\u00a0(NASDAQ: CLNE) has been working for years to change that.  It took on a lot of debt to build \"America's Natural Gas Highway,\" lining a coast-to-coast route with natural gas filling stations and placing more in major urban centers to make it easier for trucking companies to switch their fleets to from diesel to natural gas. Bloomberg The World\u2019s Hottest Stock Is a Money-Losing Tech Giant Soaring 880% (Bloomberg) -- It gets far less attention than Tesla, the FAANGs or even the Robinhood flavor of the week.Yet Sea Ltd. has quietly become the world\u2019s best-performing large-cap stock, stoking a debate on Wall Street over whether the Singapore-based gaming, e-commerce and payments company is the next great internet colossus or just Exhibit A in a global tech bubble that\u2019s destined to burst.For now at least, bulls have the upper hand. Swelling optimism that loss-making Sea may one day become both the Tencent and Alibaba of Southeast Asia has boosted its New York-listed shares by more than 880% in the past 18 months, the largest gain worldwide among companies with a starting market value of at least $1 billion. Short sellers who placed record wagers against the stock in June are retreating at an unprecedented pace.If Sea Chief Executive Officer Forrest Li is paying attention to any of this, he\u2019s not letting on. The 42-year-old billionaire said in a video interview that he\u2019s been working seven-day weeks in the office since April, leading his company through what may be its most pivotal year. Demand for Sea\u2019s mobile games and online-shopping platform has surged during the pandemic, and the company is bidding on a Singapore digital-banking license to accelerate its push into financial services. Li is also looking for potential acquisitions in gaming, logistics and e-commerce.\u201cWe don\u2019t like to think too much about our success or how we got here,\u201d he said when asked about Sea\u2019s stock price. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the environment is good or bad. It doesn\u2019t change a company or a person.\u201dEven by the standards of today\u2019s tech boom, Li\u2019s ascent has been remarkable. Born in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, he worked for the local units of Motorola Solutions Inc. and Corning Inc. before enrolling in Stanford\u2019s MBA program. He founded Sea, then known as Garena, in 2009 and took it public with backing from Tencent in 2017.Read more about Li, who named himself after Forrest Gump.After a rocky first year of trading, Sea\u2019s stock has gone on to trounce everything in its class. Initially, the gains were fueled by the runaway success of Sea\u2019s first self-made mobile game -- a battle royale called Free Fire that has attracted as many as 80 million daily active users in more than 130 markets.But Sea\u2019s e-commerce and financial services units are now increasingly important pillars of the bull case. Its Shopee platform overtook Alibaba\u2019s Lazada in the fourth quarter of 2019 to become the top e-commerce provider in Southeast Asia, according to research firm iPrice, and the business accounted for more than 40% of Sea\u2019s revenue in 2019, up from 2.3% in 2017.SeaMoney, which offers everything from e-wallets to micro loans, could ultimately be just as large, according to Li. \u201cWe think this is a huge business opportunity,\u201d he said.Read more: Sea\u2019s Singapore Digital Bank Bid Targets Millennials, SMEsThe soft-spoken founder has some big-name believers. Tencent still owns about 20% of Sea, and the stock was the biggest holding as of May in Noah Blackstein\u2019s Dynamic Power Global Growth Class fund, one of the world\u2019s top-performing equity mutual funds of the past decade. Other prominent shareholders include Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global Management LLC and Kora Management LP, an emerging markets-focused hedge fund in New York, according to regulatory filings as of March.Kora began investing in Sea in early 2018 after meeting with Li, Daniel Jacobs, the hedge fund\u2019s founding partner, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last two years a company that\u2019s got a great team and great products going after a big market and just executing incredibly well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is a mini Tencent and has the ability to be a really successful, large company in a global context.\u201dSea has already claimed the title of biggest company in Southeast Asia after its market value swelled to $65 billion, topping DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and PT Bank Central Asia for the first time earlier this year. Revenue has also grown quickly, jumping 163% to $2.2 billion in 2019, though it\u2019s still just a fraction of DBS\u2019s $11 billion.As for Sea\u2019s $1.46 billion net loss last year? Jacobs isn\u2019t bothered by it. \u201cThey are thoughtful and prudent about building a business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very much of the view that the company has all this under control.\u201dNot everyone is convinced.DBS Bank Ltd. analyst Sachin Mittal downgraded his recommendation on Sea to sell in July, citing Indonesia\u2019s new tax regulations for cross-border transactions and the likelihood of the company burning through cash to grow its payments business. \u201cThere is a tech bubble right now,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSea\u2019s stock is overvalued and it\u2019s partly a reflection of the industry.\u201dWhile short sellers have closed out bets against Sea at a rapid clip in recent weeks, they still have a bearish position worth more than $3 billion, or about 8% of the stock\u2019s free float, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. \u201cMark-to-market losses may have forced shorts out of their position,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. \u201cBut they may still have a negative outlook.\u201dSkeptics note that Sea faces deep-pocketed competitors in all of its main businesses, from Lazada to Grab Holdings Inc. and a slew of other up-and-comers in digital finance. Meanwhile, Sea\u2019s gaming unit has yet to prove it\u2019s more than just a one-hit wonder.Read more: Alibaba Helps Asia\u2019s Malls Go Online After Virus Upends Retail\u201cWe could have a post-Covid situation where the jack-up in revenue does not materialize, and the gaming business is doing well but rests on only one popular game,\u201d said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer equity research at Tellimer Ltd.Sea optimists see little reason to cash in. In fact, Georg Krijgh, founder and head of the investment team at Amsterdam-based Fratres, said his firm\u2019s Knight Tech Fund, which has 150 million euros ($177 million) under management, plans to add to its Sea holdings.The stock is already the fund\u2019s second-largest position after Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company that has gained more than 500% in the past 18 months. \u201cThere are always people who like to short excellent companies such as Sea, Tesla or Carvana, mainly based on the argument of a high valuation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inferior strategy.\u201dSea\u2019s biggest challenge now may have less to do with execution than with meeting investors\u2019 \u201csky-high\u201d expectations, said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In the past seven days alone, Sea\u2019s stock has soared 28% to record.For his part, Li appears well aware that the bar has increased. It\u2019s been hard not to notice with everyone calling his company a Southeast Asian mashup of Tencent and Alibaba, two of the most successful businesses in history.\u201cWe learned a lot from those pioneers,\u201d said Li, who has an estimated net worth of $7.5 billion. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we don\u2019t need to be their mini versions. We can just be ourselves.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Simply Wall St July 7, 2020 It is doubtless a positive to see that the The City Pub Group plc ( LON:CPC ) share price has gained some 35% in the last three months. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the returns over the last year have been disappointing. Like a receding glacier in a warming world, the share price has melted 54% in that period. The share price recovery is not so impressive when you consider the fall. Of course, it could be that the fall was overdone. View our latest analysis for City Pub Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. Unfortunately City Pub Group reported an EPS drop of 36% for the last year. This reduction in EPS is not as bad as the 54% share price fall. Unsurprisingly, given the lack of EPS growth, the market seems to be more cautious about the stock. The company\u2019s earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). AIM:CPC Earnings Per Share Growth July 7th 2020 It\u2019s probably worth noting we\u2019ve seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here. . A Different Perspective We doubt City Pub Group shareholders are happy with the loss of 54% over twelve months. That falls short of the market, which lost 9.7%. There\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s a disappointment, but the stock may well have fared better in a stronger market. It\u2019s great to see a nice little 35% rebound in the last three months. This could just be a bounce because the selling was too aggressive, but fingers crossed it\u2019s the start of a new trend. It\u2019s always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand City Pub Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example \u2013 City Pub Group has 5 warning signs (and 2 which are potentially serious) we think you should know about. City Pub Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.

Spain has had the biggest drop in output in the second quarter, with a GDP decline of 18.5%.\nPhotograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images The full extent of the impact of Covid-19 on the eurozone economy has been laid bare by figures showing the single currency zone shrank by a record 12.1% in the second quarter of 2020. Amid growing fears that Europe\u2019s tentative recovery is about to be affected by a second wave of the crisis, the European Union\u2019s statistical arm, Eurostat, provided stark evidence of the drop in activity caused by the almost total lockdowns imposed by some countries in the spring. Eurostat\u2019s data revealed that the contraction in the second quarter \u2013 when combined with a smaller fall in the first three months of the year \u2013 had wiped out a decade and a half of expansion, returning the eurozone economy to its level in the mid-2000s. Italy \u2013 which has struggled to grow since adopting the single currency \u2013 has seen its GDP return to the levels of the mid-1990s. In Spain, where concerns about a second wave are most acute, there has been the biggest drop in output in the second quarter, registering a decline in GDP of 18.5%. The fall, unmatched even during its civil war of the 1930s, followed a contraction of 5.2% in the first quarter and means that the eurozone\u2019s fourth-biggest economy shrank by almost a quarter in the first half of 2020. France, second in size only to Germany within the 19-nation single currency area, saw its GDP drop by 13.8%, while the next biggest economy, Italy, contracted by 12.4%. Germany , which reported its growth figures on Thursday, was the least bad performer of the eurozone\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d economies with a GDP contraction of 10.1% in the second quarter. The best performing countries in the eurozone were in eastern Europe and the Baltic states. Eurostat said that taken as a whole, the eurozone economy was 15% smaller than it had been a year earlier. The record-breaking drop in the April to June period of 2020 followed a fall of 3.6% in the first three months of the year and zero growth in the final quarter of 2019. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at the consultancy firm Capital Economics , said: \u201cThere are few silver linings in the data published today, which confirm that eurozone GDP slumped just as much as feared in the second quarter and that inflation remained well below target. While parts of the economy have sprung back to life over the past couple of months, the damage already done combined with the current and potential future impact of the virus mean that the recovery will be painfully slow.\u201d Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Despite the unprecedented drop in GDP in the second quarter, the worst of the economic damage from Covid-19 was caused in April and activity started to pick up in May and June as lockdown restrictions were eased. But analysts warned that full recovery would be a long process. \u201cThe hard part of this recovery is set to start about now,\u201d said Bert Colijn, senior Eurozone economist at ING Bank. \u201cFirst of all, slightly higher trending new Covid-19 cases increase the risk of reversed reopenings, and we\u2019re already seeing local signs of that. Secondly, from this point on, cautious increases in unemployment and bankruptcies and weak investment will bring to light more characteristics of a general economic slump. These factors are likely to drag on for some time, making a swift recovery to pre-corona levels of GDP out of the question.\u201d Topics Eurozone Economics Coronavirus outbreak France Italy Germany Euro news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story LGH Hotels plans to cut hundreds of jobs due to coronavirus pandemic Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza group says crisis has had \u2018dramatic\u2019 impact on business Published: 6 Aug 2020 LGH Hotels plans to cut hundreds of jobs due to coronavirus pandemic As eurozone records 3.8% slump ECB chief warns of worse to come Christine Lagarde says there could be a 15% collapse after record first quarter output fall Published: 30 Apr 2020 As eurozone records 3.8% slump ECB chief warns of worse to come Italy threatens to ban Ryanair alleging Covid-19 guideline violations Dublin-based airline, previously criticised by German health authorities, denies accusations of non-compliance Published: 6 Aug 2020 Italy threatens to ban Ryanair alleging Covid-19 guideline violations Glencore shares slide as it scraps \u00a32bn dividend and posts first-half loss Miner and commodities trader cuts value of coal and writes down \u00a32.4bn of assets Published: 6 Aug 2020 Glencore shares slide as it scraps \u00a32bn dividend and posts first-half loss Fear and mistrust as eurozone ministers debate reconstruction Published: 6 Apr 2020 Fear and mistrust as eurozone ministers debate reconstruction Live Bank of England warns UK unemployment will hit 2.5m after Covid-19 slump \u2013 as it happened Published: 6 Aug 2020 Bank of England warns UK unemployment will hit 2.5m after Covid-19 slump \u2013 as it happened The coronavirus crisis has brought the EU\u2019s failings into sharp relief Larry Elliott Published: 29 Mar 2020 Published: 29 Mar 2020 The coronavirus crisis has brought the EU\u2019s failings into sharp relief Eurozone growth close to stalling as French and Italian GDPs shrink Published: 31 Jan 2020 Eurozone growth close to stalling as French and Italian GDPs shrink More more on this story Most popular News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

A replay of the webcast will be available on the MyoKardia website for 90 days following the conference.About MyoKardia  MyoKardia\u00a0is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing targeted therapies for the treatment of serious cardiovascular diseases. The company is pioneering a precision medicine approach to its discovery and development efforts by 1) understanding the biomechanical underpinnings of disease; 2) targeting the proteins that modulate a given condition; 3) identifying patient populations with shared disease characteristics; and 4) applying learnings from research and clinical studies to inform and guide pipeline growth and product advancement. MyoKardia\u2019s initial focus is on small molecule therapeutics aimed at the proteins of the heart that modulate cardiac muscle contraction to address diseases driven by excessive contraction, impaired relaxation, or insufficient contraction. Among its discoveries are three clinical-stage therapeutics: mavacamten (formerly MYK-461); danicamtiv (formerly MYK-491) and MYK-224.\u00a0\u00a0MyoKardia\u2019s mission is to change the world for people with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.Contacts: Michelle Corral   Corporate Communications & Investor Relations  MyoKardia, Inc.  650-351-4690  mcorral@myokardia.comHannah Deresiewicz (investors)  Stern Investor Relations, Inc.  212-362-1200  hannah.deresiewicz@sternir.com GlobeNewswire MyoKardia Reports Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results BRISBANE, Calif., Aug. 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MyoKardia, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYOK), today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020.  \u201cThe second quarter of 2020 was one of incredible progress across our R&D pipeline, including the exciting new data from our danicamtiv program highlighting its unique ability to directly activate both the left atrium and the left ventricle, and capped off by the positive results from our pivotal Phase 3 EXPLORER trial. These data, together with a successful financing, position us well in the pursuit of our mission to change the world for the tens of millions of people with serious cardiovascular disease,\u201d said Tassos Gianakakos, MyoKardia\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe are highly focused on the U.S. regulatory approval and successful launch of mavacamten and continue to develop evidence supporting its potential as a backbone therapy for people with HCM and possibly beyond. Beyond mavacamten and danicamtiv, the application of our R&D platform continues to be fruitful and is generating proprietary scientific insights that could lead to several important new therapies.\u201dClinical Program HighlightsMavacamten for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy  * Positive Phase 3 Topline Data from EXPLORER-HCM: MyoKardia announced positive topline data from its Phase 3 pivotal EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial of mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Mavacamten demonstrated a robust treatment effect: the primary and all secondary endpoints were met with statistical significance (p\u22640.0006). Mavacamten was well tolerated, and meaningful improvements in symptoms, functional status and quality of life, as well as reduction or elimination in obstruction of the left ventricle, were observed among patients on treatment versus placebo.   \u00a0  * EXPLORER Data Accepted for Late-Breaker Presentation at ESC 2020: The Phase 3 data from the EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial have been accepted as a late-breaker presentation at the upcoming virtual European Society of Cardiology (ESC) meeting. Dr. Iacopo Olivotto, from the Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy, will present the data on Saturday, August 29, 2020 at 6:30 CET.   \u00a0  * Breakthrough Therapy Designation Granted by FDA: MyoKardia announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic, obstructive HCM. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is planned for use to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. MyoKardia plans to submit a New Drug Application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2021.   \u00a0  * Initiated VALOR-HCM Phase 3 Clinical Trial: The Phase 3 VALOR-HCM trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to provide direct clinical evidence of mavacamten\u2019s ability to improve outcomes for individuals with HCM by reducing the need for invasive septal reduction therapy (SRT) procedures. VALOR-HCM is being conducted in partnership with Cleveland Clinic C5Research, an academic research organization, with participation from approximately 15 HCM specialty centers with well-recognized expertise in SRT procedures in the U.S.Danicamtiv for Dilated Cardiomyopathy   * Presented and Published Encouraging Danicamtiv Clinical and Non-clinical Data: In a Phase 2a clinical trial, danicamtiv was generally well-tolerated in patients with stable chronic heart failure and was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in left ventricular (LV) contractility, including statistically significant increases in LV stroke volume, without impairing the heart\u2019s ability to relax and fill. Treatment with danicamtiv also improved left atrial (LA) volume and function, a new and potentially important finding given LA size is a well-established prognostic factor for atrial fibrillation. Data from nonclinical studies indicate that danicamtiv directly activates the LV and LA, providing mechanistic rationale for the robust changes observed clinically. These data were presented at the European Society of Cardiology\u2019s Heart Failure Association (HFA) Discoveries online event, and published in the European Journal of Heart Failure.    Pending circumstances related to the coronavirus pandemic, MyoKardia expects to initiate a Phase 2 study in patients with genetic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in the second half of 2020 and a Phase 2 study in patients with systolic heart failure and paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation in the first half of 2021.Research  * Entered into Collaboration with Fulcrum Therapeutics: MyoKardia announced a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Fulcrum Therapeutics. Under the agreement, MyoKardia will access Fulcrum\u2019s proprietary target discovery engine to identify therapeutics that control the expression of genes known to be underlying drivers of genetic cardiomyopathies. MyoKardia will be responsible for all development and commercialization activities for, and will have global rights to, any potential therapeutics identified through this collaboration.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0In March 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, MyoKardia paused new patient enrollment in the MAVA-LTE long-term extension study of mavacamten and in the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study of MYK-224. The company has subsequently resumed enrollment in both studies.Recent Corporate Highlights  * Announced New General Counsel: MyoKardia appointed Denelle J. Waynick as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Cynthia Ladd, MyoKardia\u2019s former General Counsel, will be retiring following a transition period in the second half of 2020.  \u00a0  * Completed Successful Follow-On Offering: MyoKardia completed a follow-on offering of 6,037,500 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $105.00 per share, raising approximately $605.0 million in net proceeds. MyoKardia anticipates using net proceeds from the offering to support the regulatory approval process and potential commercial launch of mavacamten for the treatment of obstructive HCM; to fund ongoing and potential later-stage clinical trials of mavacamten in non-obstructive HCM and HFpEF, danicamtiv in targeted segments of systolic heart failure and MYK-224; to advance ACT-1 and LUS-1 into clinical development; to fund ongoing preclinical, discovery and research programs, and for working capital, business development and other general corporate purposes.Second Quarter 2020 Financial ResultsCash Position:\u00a0Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of\u00a0June 30, 2020\u00a0were\u00a0$918.1 million, compared to $430.3 million as of December 31, 2019.\u00a0 The increase in MyoKardia\u2019s cash position is primarily attributable to net proceeds of approximately $605.0 million from MyoKardia\u2019s follow-on offering of common stock, which priced in May 2020.R&D Expenses:\u00a0Research and development expenses were\u00a0$44.3 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared to\u00a0$27.7 million\u00a0for the same period in 2019. The increase in R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of R&D reimbursements from Sanofi, our previous collaboration partner, increased personnel costs including stock-based compensation, as well as increases in R&D infrastructure, consulting, and contract manufacturing expenses.\u00a0\u00a0G&A Expenses:\u00a0General and administrative expenses were\u00a0$20.3 million\u00a0for the three months ended\u00a0June 30, 2020, compared to\u00a0$13.9 million\u00a0for the same period in 2019. The increase in G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs including stock-based compensation, as well as increases in professional fees and marketing expenses.Net Loss:\u00a0Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was\u00a0$63.6 million ($1.27 per share), compared to a net loss of\u00a0$38.2 million ($0.83 loss per share) for the second quarter of 2019.Conference Call and Webcast  MyoKardia\u00a0management will host a conference call and live audio webcast on\u00a0Tuesday, August 4, 2020, at\u00a04:30 p.m. ET\u00a0/\u00a01:30 p.m. PT\u00a0to discuss current operations and second quarter 2020 financial results.

McCombie Fool.co.uk 8 June 2020 Reblog Share Tweet Share Shelves holding drinks bottles More I think Young\u2019s (LSE: YNGA) is the best pub stock to buy today as pubs look set to open early than expected. Ministers are pushing for outside spaces, like beer gardens and terraces, to be allowed to open on 22 June. Inside spaces should open later on 4 July. However, I would caution investors against getting overly optimistic about the pub sector in general. Its a pub, just not as we know it For one thing, a new spike in coronavirus infections could push back the reopening dates, or force pubs to shut again. For another, the planned reopenings will be very restrictive. Two-metre social distancing will limit customer numbers to under 40% of normal. There will be queues to get in and for toilets, and propping up the bar will not be allowed. Some pub chains have already opened for takeaway during the spell of sunny weather. Passing pints over the walls to customers to consume elsewhere was not widespread, and you have to wonder why. It might be because supermarkets and corner shops already sell alcohol for consumption off the premises. Or it could be because most pubs didn\u2019t want to risk people getting drunk in public on their beer. It could also be that a takeaway service did not make financial sense. Pubs are burning through cash as premises sit idle, but they could continue to do so with limited openings. I think the number of staff will need to be something like a world cup semi-final would call for, but with a fraction of the customers. And those customers might not be knocking their drinks back like they used to. Pacing themselves Young\u2019s boss has said none of its pubs will open before early August. Given that Young\u2019s has already warned of a substantial loss for 2020 and has cut its dividend, it might sound mad to pass on the option to open early. But I see Young\u2019s not in a hurry to rush an opening as a reason why its the best pub stock to buy today. The company has already informed investors that it could remain closed without going bust until March 2021. It has made use of the government\u2019s job retention and business rate relief schemes, and will not want to jeopardise them until it makes sense to do so. Young\u2019s management expects social distancing rules of one-metre in August, which should allow pubs to operate at around 70% of capacity. At over two-thirds capacity, it seems Young\u2019s management is confident of at least not adding to the losses it is already making. It could also learn from the experiences of other pubs that may open this month, and avoid a potentially tricky emergency shut down should the outbreak spike again in the coming weeks. Last orders, please Getting a slice of Young\u2019s pre-crisis revenue, earnings, and dividend growth would be a steal at the current share price. Emerging from the crisis in an orderly fashion and avoiding doing more damage will help Young\u2019s get back on track. Having management brave enough to keep doors shut until it makes sense to open \u2013\u00a0and having the financial strength to allow this \u2013\u00a0bodes well for Young\u2019s.

Simply Wall St March 20, 2020 Unfortunately for some shareholders, the Barco ( EBR:BAR ) share price has dived 51% in the last thirty days. Even longer term holders have taken a real hit with the stock declining 18% in the last year. All else being equal, a share price drop should make a stock more attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that long term investors have an opportunity when expectations of a company are too low. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. See our latest analysis for Barco How Does Barco\u2019s P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers? We can tell from its P/E ratio of 14.45 that there is some investor optimism about Barco. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (13.1) for companies in the electronic industry is lower than Barco\u2019s P/E. ENXTBR:BAR Price Estimation Relative to Market, March 20th 2020 That means that the market expects Barco will outperform other companies in its industry. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling . How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios Probably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the \u2018E\u2019 will be higher. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases. Barco increased earnings per share by a whopping 26% last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 39% per year over the last five years. So we\u2019d generally expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio. A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The Bank One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn\u2019t take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash). While growth expenditure doesn\u2019t always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores. Barco\u2019s Balance Sheet With net cash of \u20ac356m, Barco has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 26% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio. The Bottom Line On Barco\u2019s P/E Ratio Barco trades on a P/E ratio of 14.4, which is above its market average of 11.8. With cash in the bank the company has plenty of growth options \u2014 and it is already on the right track. So it does not seem strange that the P/E is above average. Given Barco\u2019s P/E ratio has declined from 29.7 to 14.4 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is significantly less confident about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity. Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is better than it expects, you can make money by buying and holding for the long term.

And while they are reducing their exposures in response to the pandemic, insurers are also applying lessons learned in the 2008 financial crisis to help their clients weather the storm and protect their own reputations. Claims on the way Trade credit insurance protects suppliers against non-payment or late payment for goods or services provided on credit, typically triggered by financial difficulty or insolvency of their trading partners. As a result, trade credit insurers are particularly exposed during economic downturns. The collective claims ratio for members of the International Credit Insurance & Surety Association, or ICISA, jumped to 84.9% in 2008 from 45.6% in 2007, and rose further to 87.0% in 2009 because of financial crisis claims. The coronavirus outbreak has already contributed to some insolvencies, such as long-struggling U.K. home furnishings company Laura Ashley. Although the picture is still highly uncertain, travel restrictions and the enforced closure of bars, restaurants and theaters to curtail the spread of the virus are expected to push more firms into financial difficulty. James Steele-Perkins, senior credit and political risk underwriter at Cincinnati Global Underwriting Ltd., said via email that the trade credit insurance market is \"highly correlated\" with the production, processing and sale of commodities, so \"naturally we're heavily exposed to the entire supply chain.\" He said that although the impact was \"anyone's guess,\" there would be \"delays, restructurings and no doubt insolvencies, particularly within the more volatile sectors \u2014 clearly the energy industry being one and the aviation sector another.\" Scott Ettien, global trade credit head at broker Willis Towers Watson PLC, said insurers are expecting \"severe spikes in insolvencies, which is going to trigger a lot of claims activity.\" Insurers would also need to set aside reserves for payments that were past their due dates, pushing up their overall incurred loss levels, he added in an interview. He projected that the three market leaders \u2014 Atradius NV, Coface SA and Euler Hermes Group SA \u2014 \"are going to get hit with the highest number of losses,\" although all trade credit insurers will face claims. The increase in claims is likely to hit underwriting performance, according to Manuel Arrive, a director in the insurance group at Fitch Ratings. He said in an interview that Fitch was expecting a \"deterioration in technical results\" as \"claim rates should be increasing significantly due to the rising corporate insolvencies in a context where global GDP growth is being crushed.\" A resilient market While trade credit insurers' underwriting results may suffer, capital levels are not at risk, for now at least. Robert Nijhout, executive director of ICISA, said in an interview that the industry is \"extremely well-capitalized\" thanks to Europe's Solvency II regime and that the industry's 2019 performance was \"very, very good.\" Ettien noted that while typical economic cycles last between six and eight years, there had been roughly 12 years since the last severe economic downturn, and that \"during that time the carriers have been financially doing very well and are well-capitalized.\" Nijhout also said that although the outbreak could prompt a wave of corporate insolvencies, trade credit insurers are \"geared up for this \u2014 this is how we are capitalized, this is how we are organized, this is how we are also in control of the risk we are underwriting.\" Arrive said the short-term nature of trade credit insurance meant that insurers could react quickly by implementing risk measures, such as reducing coverage limits. The big three trade credit insurers provide cancellable cover, which allows them to reduce or withdraw coverage limits if a customer looks likely to go bust or be unable to pay, thereby reducing their and their insureds' exposure. Insurers can also put up prices, Arrive said, adding that Fitch was expecting \"double-digit\" rate increases. Ettien said he was expecting prices to go up by more than 10% for new business, while price increases for existing clients were \"probably going to sit around the 10% range.\" Lessons learned Trade credit insurers' efforts to reduce their exposure through lower limits and higher prices could risk client relationships, however. Reducing limits \"is a risk management tool that they have here but they need to do business and not lose their clients,\" Arrive said. Ettien acknowledged that \"some people are going to get upset\" because of canceled credit limits and that \"it's not going to be a perfect world from that perspective.\" But he added that \"nobody is taking any drastic moves, any knee-jerk reactions\" on pulling back coverage, and that both insurers and clients seemed to be \"very level-headed\" in their responses. He added that insurer response to date has been \"night and day\" compared with the 2008 financial crisis \"and in my book they get an A+ on how they are reacting so far.\" Nijhout said ICISA's member insurers were being more flexible on extensions of customer payment deadlines. This would typically be \"more frowned upon because we want to know why companies don't pay,\" but given the pandemic it is \"much, much clearer\" why there is a delay, he said. The reason for insurers' measured response, according to Ettien, is the lessons learned in the 2008 financial crisis. He recalled that at the time the big three insurers were giving one day's notice of credit limit cancellation, which \"created a lot of problems.\" Since then, he said, they have introduced a \"delayed effect of cancellation\" endorsement to policies, allowing insureds time to reduce their exposures to troubled customers gradually over a 30-, 60- or 90-day period, provided that customers were not insolvent or already 60 days past their due payment date. Ettien said he expects the delayed effect endorsement to be tested during the coronavirus pandemic but that it will \"have a positive impact in this downturn for our insureds.\" He added: \"I think our reputation at the end of this is going to be stronger than what happened when we came out of 2008 \u2014 much, much stronger.\" Author Ben Dyson Theme Insurance About Us Quality Program Contact Us Email Subscription Center Press Releases Careers Corporate Responsibility Our History Investor Relations Leadership \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Terms of Use Cookie Notice Privacy Policy Disclosures Do Not Sell My Personal Information"},

This week, the strict rules on distancing which require people to stay 2 metres apart when they are out and about or at work are expected to be changed , in a move which will be welcomed by the hospitality industry. Many pubs and restaurants were forced to shut down completely in March, and have been struggling to work out how to accommodate customers when they are allowed to reopen from 4 July. Shepherd is amongst the many business owners who are planning to reopen when the lockdown restrictions on pubs and restaurants are relaxed, and said any changes to physical distancing rules will make a huge difference to his income. While the pub is lucky enough to have a garden and car park to fill, the real difficulty will be indoor seating, he said, especially if the weather turns bad. With the 2-metre rule in place, Shepherd expects to be able to fit just eight to 12 patrons inside. That figure jumps to 60 if the distance is cut in half. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to do all sorts of things in terms of gazebos and where we can put up shelters or whatever, but a change to a 1-metre rule definitely makes the pub a more viable operation in the short term,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cIt goes from being a hobby that we cling to to being a viable business.\u201d Ben Squire runs passenger ferries and a cafe in Plymouth and was just about to open a seafood restaurant, the Hook & Line, when lockdown started. Instead of a grand opening, he started offering takeaways a few weeks ago. He said a change in the rules would be \u201cmake or break\u201d for businesses like his. \u201cWe can have about 80 customers without social distancing, so at 2 metres we were looking at about 20. The margins are tight anyway.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Squire, left, was about to open the Hook & Line restaurant in Plymouth when lockdown began. He added: \u201cIf it does go to 1 metre, there\u2019s a little bit of life in that, we are in with a good chance, so I am hoping that happens.\u201d Stephen Turvil, who owns the Herne Tavern in East Dulwich, London, said the change from a 2-metre rule to 1-metre distancing would make \u201ca huge difference \u2013 that will return us almost to normal capacity\u201d. His pub also has a large garden. \u201cIf the 2-metre rule stays, we\u2019ll have to get rid of half of the tables in the garden, but if it\u2019s 1 metre we will be OK.\u201d The pub has been closed during lockdown, and he has taken the opportunity to get the floors redecorated. \u201cAll of the table and chairs are currently stacked up and I am reluctant to put them back out until we have clear guidelines,\u201d he said. The pub is set to reopen on 4 July, and will operate table service with staff taking orders and bringing drinks from the bar, and a limited food menu. In the men\u2019s toilets, the middle urinal will be taped off. Changes to physical distancing rules won\u2019t make any difference to those plans, he says. Turvil says he has still not had any clear communication about the rules. And he has concerns about the day that has been chosen for reopening. \u201cI would much rather it wasn\u2019t a Saturday \u2013 I think there will be teething problems, so I think they should put it back, maybe to the Wednesday afterwards. We could wait and reopen later, but I worry that would give our competitors an advantage.\u201d Topics Coronavirus outbreak Pubs Restaurants Travel & leisure Food & drink industry news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most popular World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

And now Covid-19 is being used as an excuse to silence more voices. By Gill Phillips Main image:\nIllustration: Guardian Design Thu 28 May 2020 06.00\u00a0BST Last modified on Wed 3 Jun 2020 10.37\u00a0BST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email J ust after 7am on the morning of 23 March 2017, journalist Miroslava Breach Velducea , a 54-year-old mother of three, was driving her 14-year-old son to school in the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, when a man walked up to her car and shot her eight times. According to reports, her son was not injured, but Breach died on the way to hospital. The Mexican newspaper la Jornada reported that a cardboard note was found at the scene of the murder, which read: \u201cFor being a snitch. You\u2019re next, Governor \u2013 El 80.\u201d According to Mexican police, \u201cEl 80\u201d was Carlos Arturo Quintana, son of the leader of an organised crime syndicate known as La L\u00ednea, which in its heyday controlled one of the lucrative smuggling routes for the supply and transfer of drugs from Colombia to the US. Three days before Breach was murdered, Quintana\u2019s father had been killed in a confrontation between rival gangs. Breach worked for la Jornada and for the regional paper Norte de Ciudad Juarez, covering politics and crime; she had also set up her own news agency, Mir. She had reported extensively on the links between organised crime and politicians in Chihuahua state. On 4 March 2016, Breach wrote in la Jornada about the alleged criminal connections of mayoral candidates in several small towns in western Chihuahua. Breach had received threats to her life on at least three occasions as a result of her reporting. In October 2016, she had told a meeting of the Federal Mechanism for Journalists and Human Rights Defenders that she had been threatened. Nevertheless, on the day she was killed, she had no protection. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A protest in Mexico City after the murder of Miroslava Breach in 2017. Photograph: Daniel Cardenas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Breach\u2019s story is not an isolated one. She was one of six journalists killed in Mexico in 2017; more than 150 journalists have been killed there since 2000, 22 of them in the state of Chihuahua. In 2019, according to data compiled by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Mexico had the seventh-highest number of unsolved murders of journalists in the world, behind Somalia, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, the Philippines and Afghanistan. On 18 May this year, gunmen killed the owner of a newspaper, Jorge Miguel Armenta \u00c1valos, and one of the policemen assigned to protect him, following earlier threats. Armenta, who is at least the third journalist to be murdered in Mexico in 2020, was attacked in broad daylight while leaving a restaurant. According to the World Press Freedom Index for 2020, compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and released in March, journalists in Mexico face a dire situation: \u201cCollusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists\u2019 safety and cripples the judicial system at all levels. Journalists who cover sensitive political stories or organized crime are warned, threatened and often gunned down in cold blood.\u201d A ttacks on journalists around the world take many forms, some of which are sanctioned in law. Legal or quasi-legal mechanisms include the use of civil or criminal legal actions, covert surveillance, overt censorship and financial threats (such as withdrawing state advertising), as well as more direct intimidation and threats. In recent years, another way of silencing journalists has proliferated: the use of what are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or Slapps , where defamation or criminal lawsuits are brought with the intention of shutting down forms of expression such as peaceful protest or writing blogs. Originally regarded as an American legal mechanism, such lawsuits are now fairly widespread in Europe. Before she was killed in 2017, the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was facing around 40 libel lawsuits filed by companies, government officials and individuals, which were described by her son Matthew as a \u201cnever-ending type of torture\u201d. V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the vice-president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, has been working on introducing protections against Slapp lawsuits, the defence of which can cost individuals a fortune and tie up their time and resources. Justin Borg-Barthet, a legal academic at Aberdeen University, has called for EU law to be changed to prevent \u201cforum shopping\u201d to countries with claimant-friendly laws, so that defamation suits would have to be filed in the courts of the country where the media organisation or journalist was based. Slapp lawsuits are commonly used against journalists investigating government corruption or exposing corporate abuses, but are also used against civil society organisations, activists such as environmental campaigners, trade unionists and academics, to shut down or silence acts of criticism and protest. In France, media organisations and NGOs have been hit with what they view as Slapp suits for publishing accusations of land-grabbing from villagers and farmers in Cameroon by companies associated with the Bollor\u00e9 Group. In the UK, fracking companies including Ineos, UK Oil & Gas, Cuadrilla, IGas and Angus Energy have since 2017 sought and been granted wide-ranging court injunctions, often directed against persons unknown, to prevent protests and campaigning activities at drilling sites. These injunctions had a chilling effect on the right to protest and free speech, until the court of appeal ruled in April 2019 that parts of an Ineos injunction prohibiting protests on the public highway and against the Ineos supply chain, and which had been used as a template for similar orders granted to other oil and gas companies, were unlawful. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017. Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters Alongside Slapp suits, there are more traditional ways to keep journalists quiet. More than 150 countries retain some sort of criminal defamation laws, many of which include the possibility of imprisonment. Blasphemy and insult laws remain commonplace in many countries, and are often used by politicians and government officials against any critical media. A number of countries including Turkey and Egypt have expansive definitions of \u201cterrorism\u201d that allow them to arrest and detain anyone who voices political dissent or opposition, including journalists. In countries such as Hungary and Poland, governments and political allies exercise quasi-legal control of public information. Media owners can be pressured on what content to publish by threats to limit access to finance and advertising revenues. Separately, the lack of legal protections for journalists against those who attack them acts as a strong deterrent. Impunity fuels a vicious cycle of violence, bolstering those who aim to silence public debate and block sensitive information. In 2013, the UN published a plan of action on the safety of journalists, and the problem of impunity for perpetrators. The plan provides a framework for co-operation between UN bodies, national authorities, media actors and NGOs. Spearheaded through Unesco, the plan was incorporated into the Declaration of the Council of Europe in April 2014, and in guidelines published by the EU soon after. In April 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors. By the end of 2018, the Council of Europe\u2019s Platform for the Protection of Journalism and Safety of Journalists , set up to record information on serious concerns about media freedom and the safety of journalists in Council of Europe (CoE) member states, had registered more than 500 alerts , with year-on-year rises of incidents in every year except 2017. Nearly half of all alerts are marked as category 1, covering the most severe and damaging violations of media freedom, such as murder, direct threats to life and physical assaults. The majority of threats came from the state, with physical attacks and detentions making up nearly half the alerts. Since 2015, only 11% of all alerts have been marked as resolved, a figure that goes down to 1.82% for alerts entered in 2018. Interviews with journalists echo these statistics. In 2017, a study that interviewed 940 journalists from all CoE member states found that a staggering 40% of them had suffered slander. According to a May 2020 report by Peter Noorlander on the implementation of the 2016 CoE recommendation, attacks against journalists remain insufficiently investigated, and a very high percentage of incidents go unpunished. \u201cJournalists have little confidence that attacks or threats against them will be investigated, and often do not report them,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis has a grave effect on them, and many no longer report attacks but instead self-censor and shy away from potentially controversial issues \u2026 [CoE] Member States have committed to creating an enabling environment for freedom of expression, yet, what journalists experience on the ground is increased violence, threats, denigration, arbitrary arrests and detention.\u201d S ome of the most high-profile cases of attacks against the media in the last few years have involved journalists in countries where neither democracy nor the rule of law is respected. Many of the more recent attacks have been perpetrated or encouraged by heads of state. They include cases such as the politically sponsored harassment of Philippines journalist Maria Ressa , the editor of Rappler, a social news network. Under Ressa, the site has revealed the activities of the online \u201ctroll army\u201d that supports the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte and spreads disinformation about his opponents. Rappler has also reported critically on extrajudicial killings, human-rights violations and the rising death rates from Duterte\u2019s war on drugs . The law suits that would follow were presaged during Duterte\u2019s state of the union speech in July 2017, when he declared that Rappler was \u201cfully owned\u201d by the Americans, and therefore in violation of the constitution. In January 2018, the Philippine securities and exchange commission revoked Rappler\u2019s licence. The government then investigated Rappler for tax evasion, and a warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest was issued in November 2018. In February 2019, Ressa and Rappler were hit with another lawsuit alleging libel relating to a story published in 2012, using a law enacted four months after the story was published. Other infamous cases of state-sponsored crimes against journalists include the brutal murder , on 2 October 2018, of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The CIA have concluded that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the journalist\u2019s assassination. On 19 July 2019, the office of the UNHCR released a report describing Khashoggi\u2019s death as \u201cpremeditated extra judicial execution\u201d. In many western countries, there is a risk that intimidation and violence against the media is becoming normalised. On Czech election day in October 2017, Czech president Milo \u0161 Zeman held up a mock assault rifle with an inscription that was translated as \u201cAt journalists\u201d. Donald Trump has regularly shouted at and abused journalists, and a BBC camera operator was violently shoved and abused at a Donald Trump rally in 2019; in May 2017, a Guardian reporter was assaulted by a Republican candidate, now an elected congressman. Most recently there have been threats against reporter Glenn Greenwald from the far-right government of President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. This sort of hostility towards journalists by political leaders has global as well as domestic repercussions.

Photograph: Miroslav Chaloupka/\u010cTK/Alamy Stock Photo The Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is currently held in HMP Belmarsh, while the UK decides if he can be extradited to the US, where he has been charged with violating the Espionage Act, and faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if he is found guilty. As Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of the Guardian, has written , the charges against Assange are \u201cattempting to criminalise things journalists regularly do when they receive and publish true information given to them by sources or whistleblowers\u201d. According to the RSF , \u201cthe next 10 years will be pivotal for press freedom because of converging crises affecting the future of journalism: a geopolitical crisis (due to the aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes); a technological crisis (due to a lack of democratic guarantees); a democratic crisis (due to polarisation and repressive policies); a crisis of trust (due to suspicion and even hatred of the media); and an economic crisis (impoverishing quality journalism).\u201d It is easy to dismiss concerns about press freedom as relevant only to countries led by repressive, unelected regimes. But that would be a mistake. In 2007, Thames Valley police searched the home and office of Sally Murrer, a local journalist. \u201cI was just pottering around doing typical local stories and in May 2007, eight police officers swooped at my home while eight swooped simultaneously at the office,\u201d she told reporters from the Press Gazette. \u201cThey seized all my computer equipment, searched my house, phones, laptops. They took me into custody where I stayed for a couple of days, strip-searched me. I honestly had no idea [why]. They said the charge was aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and it carried life imprisonment. \u201cIt was only later when they interviewed me, which they did copious times, and played me tapes and showed me transcripts of texts, that I realised I had been under surveillance for the previous eight weeks. It was just a ghastly feeling.\u201d Thames Valley police had secretly recorded a conversation that took place between her and a police officer. Murrer was accused of receiving sensitive stories from the police officer and selling them to the News of the World. \u201cThe stories were about a local GBH committed by a footballer, and the murder of a local man where there was a link to cannabis and his wife was the secretary of the then-MP.\u201d After 19 months, during which she had been on police bail, Murrer\u2019s trial collapsed after the judge ruled police had breached her rights. More recently, in August 2018, the police in Northern Ireland arrested two journalists, Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey, over the alleged theft of documents from the Northern Ireland police ombudsman into the 1994 Loughinisland massacre , when members of a loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, burst into a pub with assault rifles and fired on the customers. Six were killed and five wounded. Birney and McCaffrey\u2019s homes and offices were raided. In May 2019, three appeal judges quashed the search warrants.

Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA In the US in 2019, San Francisco police officers investigating the leak of a police report following the death of a public defender, Jeff Adachi, obtained a warrant \u201cto conduct remote monitoring on a journalist\u2019s telephone number device, day or night, including those signals produced in public, or location not open to public or visual surveillance\u201d. In May 2019, the police raided the journalist Bryan Carmody\u2019s home and office, and seized computers, phones and other electronic devices. A court has now ruled that the raid was unlawful, and the San Francisco police department has reportedly paid a substantial amount of damages to the journalist. In Australia, in June 2019, police launched raids on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s Sydney HQ, with search warrants naming two reporters and a news director; and on the home of a News Corporation journalist. The ABC raid\u00a0related to articles published in 2017 about alleged misconduct by Australian special forces in Afghanistan, \u201cbased off hundreds of pages of secret defence documents leaked to the ABC\u201d. The raid on the home of the News Corporation journalist was in response to a story she had written about how the Australian Signals Directorate was seeking new powers to spy on Australian citizens. In February, a court ruled the search was legitimate as the police were investigating valid national security offences. ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, described the decision as \u201ca blow for public interest journalism\u201d and argued that it highlighted a \u201cserious problem\u201d with Australia\u2019s national security laws. S ince the outbreak of coronavirus, protections for journalists have become more urgent than ever. According to RSF\u2019s secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor.\u201d \u201cBoth China and Iran censored their major coronavirus outbreaks extensively. In Iraq, the authorities stripped Reuters of its licence for three months after it published a story questioning official coronavirus figures. Even in Europe, prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n of Hungary had a \u2018coronavirus\u2019 law passed with penalties of up to five years in prison for false information, a completely disproportionate and coercive measure.\u201d RSF also say reporters have been arrested in Algeria, Jordan and Zimbabwe while reporting on lockdown-related issues, and that Cambodia\u2019s prime minister has used the coronavirus crisis to bolster his authority. In March, the Guardian journalist Ruth Michaelson was forced to leave Egypt after she reported on a scientific study that said Egypt was likely to have many more coronavirus cases than have been officially confirmed, and the New York Times Cairo bureau chief was reprimanded over supposed \u201cbad faith\u201d reporting on the country\u2019s coronavirus cases. The Columbia Journalism Review, in an article entitled \u201cCovid-19 is spawning a global press-freedom crackdown\u201d, reported at the end of March that police in Venezuela had violently detained a journalist in reprisal for reporting on the pandemic, and that in Turkey, seven journalists were detained in reprisal for their reporting. In South Africa, the government has enacted a new law that makes it a crime to publish \u201cdisinformation\u201d about Covid-19. In light of the pandemic, the UK and other members of the executive group of the Media Freedom Coalition (Canada, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands and the US), agreed a statement on 6 April 2020, reaffirming the fundamental importance of media freedom, and calling on all states to continue to protect access to free media and the free exchange of information. The statement said that the executive group were concerned by the efforts by some states to use the crisis to put in place undue restrictions on a free and independent media: \u201cSuch actions deny societies critical information on the spread of the disease and undermine trust in responsible government\u201d. It also urged \u201cgovernments to continue guaranteeing the freedom and independence of media, the safety of journalists and other media professionals, and to refrain from imposing undue restrictions in the fight against proliferation of the coronavirus\u201d. O n the day of the murder of Miroslava Breach Velducea in 2017, Mexico\u2019s federal special prosecutor for crimes against freedom of expression stated that a federal investigation had begun. Seven days later, according to la Jornada , Chihuahua\u2019s attorney general said that two suspects had been identified in the shooting, and that Breach was killed because her reporting affected the interests of organised crime. Later that year, the finger of blame for the killing was pointed at \u201cLos Salazares\u201d, a criminal organisation linked to the Sinaloa cartel, led by the Mexican drug lord El Chapo , who has since been convicted in the US for trafficking tons of cocaine, heroin and marijuana and engaging in multiple murder conspiracies, and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison . A hitman linked to Los Salazares \u2013 Juan Carlos Moreno Ochoa, alias \u201cEl Larry\u201d \u2013 was arrested by authorities on Christmas Day 2017 during an early morning raid. Surveillance cameras had captured him walking in the vicinity of the murder scene. In March 2020, a federal court judge found Moreno guilty of overseeing the journalist\u2019s murder. Testifying under the alias \u201cApolo\u201d, the son of the leader of Los Salazares gave evidence about how his father was upset that a relative lost a mayoral election in the town of Chinipas, el Heraldo newspaper reported. The judge found that Moreno supervised the crime and enlisted the help of two other people, Jaciel Vega Villa, who allegedly drove the car to Breach\u2019s home, and Ram\u00f3n Andr\u00e9s Zavala Corral, who was suspected of having fired the shots that fatally wounded her. Zavala had been found dead in December 2017, a few days before Moreno Ochoa\u2019s arrest. Vega remains at large, a fugitive from justice. Rwanda\u2019s Khashoggi: who killed the exiled spy chief? Read more The guilty verdict came too late to save Breach\u2019s newspaper. In April 2017, the editor of Norte de Ciudad Juarez, where Breach had worked, announced that the paper was closing. In an editorial published shortly after the assassination, Oscar Cant\u00fa said he could not continue to publish in the face of the violence against journalists in Mexico and the impunity of those responsible. \u201cThere are neither the guarantees nor the security to exercise critical, balanced journalism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything in life has a beginning and an end, and a price to pay, and if the price is life, I am not prepared for any more of my colleagues to pay it, nor am I prepared to pay it either.\u201d The work of journalists in all media around the world is even more important at a time when misinformation and disinformation spread so rapidly across the internet, and when powerful political and business actors can attack journalists with impunity. As Unesco said in their campaign literature for this year\u2019s World Press Freedom Day: \u201cToday, citizens are on lockdown, eager for news like never before. And more than ever, the news must be fact-checked, verified. Because disinformation spreads as fast as the virus itself, and journalists are on the frontline in the fight against the distortion of truth. More than ever we need facts. Facts to avoid spreading fear, fake news and panic. More than ever we need a free press.\u201d Gill Phillips is director of editorial legal services at the Guardian \u2022 This article was amended on 28 May 2020 to clarify details of the respective raids on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and on the home of a News Corporation journalist in 2019. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread , and sign up to the long read weekly email here Topics The long read Press freedom Newspapers & magazines Freedom of speech Jamal Khashoggi Daphne Caruana Galizia Donald Trump features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most popular UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

One of the oldest continually-run hospitality venues on Waiheke Island in Auckland\u2019s Hauraki Gulf has been placed on the market for sale. Vino Vino at 153 Ocean View Road in Oneroa is a Mediterranean-themed bar and restaurant which has been serving drinks and meals for some 27 years. The 90-seater venue is located on the hill-top ridge of Oneroa\u2019s main street \u2013 providing unobstructed views overlooking one of Waiheke\u2019s longest and busiest beaches just a few hundred metres away. Vino Vino makes the most of its prime position with a large outdoor deck serving area. For 10 months a year, the venue runs seven days a week opening for lunch and dinner. During July and August each year, Vino Vino is closed to allow the hands-on owners a chance to re-charge their batteries back in their beloved homeland of Croatia. Now wanting to spend more time in Croatia with their children and ever-growing number of grandchildren, the Vino Vino business \u2013 but not the land and buildings in which it is housed \u2013 is being marketed for sale by negotiation through Bayleys Real Estate\u2019s hospitality business sales division. Salespeople Carolyn Hanson and Markus Blum said Vino Vino\u2019s reputation on Waiheke was among a privileged handful of such hospitality businesses to have been around for almost 30 years. \u201cOver the past decade of trading, Vino Vino has allowed its owners to comfortably operate the business as a lifestyle enterprise. New owners could well look at continuing on with a model which has worked so successfully for its current operators for the past 14 years, or taking Vino Vino in a new direction,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cAny new operational changes could also include opening up for breakfasts \u2013 at least on weekends to start with \u2013 as well as driving group bookings for functions and events. A refurbishment of the interior to reflect a new menu would also be another option available to any new owner.\u201d Vino Vino employs a core complement of 11 staff \u2013 including two chefs and two kitchen hands, three full-time front of house personnel and a further three part-time front of house personnel, and a restaurant manager. This core number expands during the peak summer period between November and March. Hanson said that in addition to marketing its activities locally on Waiheke through \u2018word-of-mouth\u2019 referrals, Vino Vino utilised digital channels such as Facebook and Instagram to target incoming visitors to the island. \u201cVino Vino\u2019s location in the middle of Oneroa\u2019s main retail strip ensures a high level of \u2018passing trade\u2019 from casual clientele. Concurrently, the food and beverage offerings and pricing levels are generally targeted toward repeat business from a local clientele. It\u2019s not competing with the island\u2019s winery restaurants for customer trade, and has never sought to do so,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cAs a result of this domestic focus, the Vino Vino business has bounced back relatively quickly from the impacts of Covid-19 level four and level three trading restrictions.\u201d Blum said Vino Vino\u2019s owners would look at undertaking a \u2018hand-over\u2019 transition for any potential purchaser who was new to the hospitality sector. The 471-square metre Vino Vino venue is on a lease at its Ocean View Road premises, currently running through to 2028 and paying annual rental of $60,000 plus GST. Chattels included in the business for sale include a full commercial-grade kitchen encompassing walk-in chiller/freezer units, combi\u2019 ovens, gas hobs, deep fryers, substantial stainless steel food preparation benching, and crockery washing/cleaning equipment. Front of house chattels include point of sale equipment, beverage refrigeration units behind the bar, tables, chairs, crockery, glassware and cutlery. \u201cWith international tourism and travel beyond the consideration of most Aucklanders for the foreseeable future during current Covid-19 quarantine restrictions, many domestic locations within a few hours of Auckland are now benefitting. And with Waiheke being right on Auckland\u2019s doorstep, yet just a short ferry ride away from the CBD, guests to the island feel like they are going away from the city. That has been an advantage for Vino Vino prior to hibernating for winter,\u201d Blum said. Waiheke has a resident population of 9,330 people \u2013 supporting some 1,476 businesses and 3,480 employees working on the island. Auckland City Council data reports that the island attracts some 900,000 domestic and international visitors annually.

Simply Wall St August 4, 2020 Is Barco NV ( EBR:BAR ) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it\u2019s important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you\u2019ll find our analysis useful. Investors might not know much about Barco\u2019s dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last nine years and offers a 2.3% yield. While the yield may not look too great, the relatively long payment history is interesting. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ENXTBR:BAR Historic Dividend August 4th 2020 Payout ratios Dividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable \u2013 hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company\u2019s net income after tax. Barco paid out 53% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A payout ratio above 50% generally implies a business is reaching maturity, although it is still possible to reinvest in the business or increase the dividend over time. We also measure dividends paid against a company\u2019s levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Barco paid out 505% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. Barco paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn\u2019t generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Barco to repeatedly pay dividends that aren\u2019t well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign. With a strong net cash balance, Barco investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective. Consider getting our latest analysis on Barco\u2019s financial position here. Dividend Volatility One of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well \u2013 nasty. The first recorded dividend for Barco, in the last decade, was nine years ago. The company has been paying a stable dividend for a while now, which is great. However we\u2019d prefer to see consistency for a few more years before giving it our full seal of approval. During the past nine-year period, the first annual payment was \u20ac0.1 in 2011, compared to \u20ac0.4 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 11% per year over this time. The dividend has been growing pretty quickly, which could be enough to get us interested even though the dividend history is relatively short. Further research may be warranted. Dividend Growth Potential Dividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. It\u2019s good to see Barco has been growing its earnings per share at 28% a year over the past five years. With recent, rapid earnings per share growth and a payout ratio of 53%, this business looks like an interesting prospect if earnings are reinvested effectively. Conclusion To summarise, shareholders should always check that Barco\u2019s dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we think Barco has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, although its dividend history is not as long as we\u2019d like. In sum, we find it hard to get excited about Barco from a dividend perspective. It\u2019s not that we think it\u2019s a bad business; just that there are other companies that perform better on these criteria. Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

This can result in business disruptions and, potentially, financial losses. This may also lead to further detrimental consequences, ranging from a slowdown of a country\u2019s economic output to increased unemployment to financial market instability. [1] Since the Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, 180+ parties [2] have committed to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy by enacting a variety of policies, such as the introduction or increase of a carbon tax penalizing firms operating in high CO 2 -emitting sectors. [3] These transition efforts will likely require an unprecedented level of investment over the next decades. This may contribute to the onset of a new type of financial risk that could have negative effects on a company\u2019s financial performance by eroding liquidity needed to service short- and long-term debt commitments. In the next few months, several major central banks and financial regulators across the world (e.g., US Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and European Central Bank) are planning to test the financial markets\u2019 preparedness for major physical and transition risks by introducing ad-hoc scenarios to financial institutions\u2019 annual stress-testing exercises. While scenario analysis is routinely performed by risk managers at financial institutions and non-financial corporations, energy transition risks pose new challenges, such as longer time horizons needed for the analysis, the lack of quality company emission data, and the lack of an established quantitative approach linking energy transition risks and opportunities to credit risk. [4] S&P Global Market Intelligence\u2019s Climate Linked Credit Analytics offers two innovative, automated tools that address these challenges. These tools can help financial practitioners analyse the impact of a pre-defined or user-defined carbon tax increase on a firm\u2019s creditworthiness, or across companies and entire portfolios. \u2022 The upstream Oil & Gas tool offers a fundamentals-driven view of how a future carbon tax increase may affect each financial item reported within company statements over the next three years. The tool, developed in consultation with Oliver & Wyman, [5] currently covers more than 1200+ [6] public and private companies operating in one of the most carbon-intensive sectors (i.e., the upstream Oil & Gas industry). Users can explore the impact of global carbon tax scenarios (where the carbon tax increases by a user-defined percentage across all countries) or the integrated scenarios generated via a global energy-economy-climate model (REMIND). [7] The estimated financials can then be run via Credit Analytics\u2019 CreditModel TM , a quantitative model generating a credit score. The score aims to statistically match S&P Global Ratings issuer credit ratings for rated companies, which can also be applied to unrated companies. [8] \u2022 The public firms tool offers a market-driven view of how earnings of public companies may change over the next three decades under multiple carbon tax scenarios. [9] The tool leverages Trucost\u2019s company-specific GHG emission data and accommodates pre-defined country and industry-specific carbon tax scenarios or user-defined global carbon tax scenarios. The tool calculates the change in credit score between today and a future year. These tools can help users perform stress-testing and scenario analysis, as well as comply with the Task Force for Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. These recommendations are expected to become mandatory over the next few years for the signatories of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). [10] The Materials Sector: Public Firms Tool Figure 1 shows the distribution of credit score changes between 2019 and 2050 for public companies within the Materials sector, one of the highest CO 2 -emitting sectors. We employ the public firms tool for a fast (i.e., two degrees Celsius) transition scenario, where the carbon tax rapidly increases and companies react in one of four ways: Yellow bars: Companies keep increasing carbon emissions and do not invest in new/greener technology, but pay carbon taxes on increased emissions. Green bars: Companies manage to meet CO 2 emission reduction targets in 2050 by investing in greener technology and, thus, sustaining abatement costs in addition to carbon tax costs. Revenues include both a growth component and a cost-related component. Amber bars: Companies maintain current (2019) levels of CO 2 emissions, saving on abatement costs, but sustaining carbon tax costs. Revenues grow only in proportion to the fraction of total costs passed on to customers. Red bars: Companies do not invest in new/greener technology and pay high carbon taxes, plus governments introduce additional policies that forcefully reduce carbon emissions (e.g., by progressively banning use of certain materials), thus leading to revenue losses on affected companies. Fig. 1: Distribution of credit score change between 2019 and 2050, for public companies in the Materials sector over a fast transition. Please, note the semi-logarithmic scale used to zoom into the y-axis. Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. As of September 1, 2019. For illustrative purposes only. Despite some of these scenarios being quite extreme or unlikely, they are still useful to obtain a sense of the potential impact of company inaction or abrupt government policies in comparison to alternative, more rational choices. A few comments: 1. In all cases, a significant percentage of companies (up to 44%) remains with the same credit score under the fast transition. The remainder change their credit score in either direction, confirming the importance of managing risks, but also seizing opportunities over the long term. 2. In the yellow case (where emissions keep growing at a forecasted pace, and companies do not invest in new/greener technology), the distribution of score changes is skewed towards the left, due to the expected revenue growth. However, a significant number of companies may also be affected negatively, and up to 10% of firms in this sector may end up in a technical default (\u2018d\u2019) if their projected market capitalization falls to zero or to a negative value by 2050. This type of scenario essentially shows the cost of inaction by companies that simply bear carbon tax costs on increasingly higher carbon emissions. It is worth noting that the technical defaults reported here are a cumulative rate over the next 30 years. For comparison purposes, the long-term average cumulative (30-year) default rate of BBB-rated companies by S&P Global Ratings is higher than 10%. [11] 3. The green case shows the advantage of investing in new/greener technology, thus reducing carbon emissions and paying a lower carbon tax, while incurring higher operating costs on new technology. In this case, the vast majority of companies (71%) will experience an improvement in their credit scores by one or more notches, while 26% will remain with the same score, and only 1% will incur a technical (cumulative) default over the next 30 years. 4. The amber case assumes companies maintain current emission levels without converting to new technology, and will pay a hefty carbon tax (over the fast transition scenario), and increase their revenues only in proportion to the fraction of costs passed to their customers. This leads to a significant distribution skew towards the right-hand side of the graph, with 38% of companies at risk of technical default. 5. The red case corresponds to an extreme situation, where companies do not convert to new technology, but have to pay an increased carbon tax. This is while governments enforce restrictive laws to curb carbon emissions (e.g., by banning the use of obsolete technology or imposing carbon emission caps), and induce revenue losses among companies in proportion to the carbon emissions reduction. In this case, the technical (cumulative) default rate over the next 30 years increases to almost 79%, with potentially severe consequences for the Materials sector and the economy as a whole. This analysis shows the flexibility of the tool in accommodating various transition scenarios and firm behaviors, as well as the importance of striking a balance between carbon pricing policies and the actions that companies will need to take in order to adopt new technology and reduce carbon emissions. Finally, the public firms tool enables users to gauge the impact of a scenario for each individual company, rather than on a given sector. A detailed discussion at the company level will be covered in following work.

That number need not have been so high. At the time of writing, the numbers are 351,000 and 15,000 respectively . Our research did not use any complicated model with a vast number of variables, no more than someone watching an avalanche heading in their direction calls for complicated statistical models to see if they need to get out of the way. We called for a simple exercise of the precautionary principle in a domain where it mattered: interconnected complex systems have some attributes that allow some things to cascade out of control, delivering extreme outcomes. Enact robust measures that would have been, at the time, of small cost: constrain mobility . Immediately. Later, we invoked a rapid investment in preparedness: tests, hospital capacity, means to treat patients. Just in case, you know. Things can happen. The error in the UK is on two levels. Modelling and policymaking. First, at the modelling level, the government relied at all stages on epidemiological models that were designed to show us roughly what happens when a preselected set of actions are made, and not what we should make happen, and how. The modellers use hypotheses/assumptions, which they then feed into models, and use to draw conclusions and make policy recommendations. Critically, they do not produce an error rate. What if these assumptions are wrong? Have they been tested? The answer is often no. For academic papers, this is fine. Flawed theories can provoke discussion. Risk management \u2013 like wisdom \u2013 requires robustness in models. But if we base our pandemic response plans on flawed academic models, people die. And they will. This was the case with the disastrous \u201c herd immunity \u201d thesis. The idea behind herd immunity was that the outbreak would stop if enough people got sick and gained immunity. Once a critical mass of young people gained immunity, so the epidemiological modellers told us, vulnerable populations (old and sick people) would be protected. Of course, this idea was nothing more than a dressed-up version of the \u201cjust do nothing\u201d approach. Individuals and scientists around the world immediately pointed out the obvious flaws : there\u2019s no way to ensure only young people get infected; you need 60-70% of the population to be infected and recover to have a shot at herd immunity, and there aren\u2019t that many young and healthy people in the UK, or anywhere. Moreover, many young people have severe cases of the disease, overloading healthcare systems, and a not-so-small number of them die. It is not a free ride. This doesn\u2019t even include the possibility, already suspected in some cases, of re ccurrence of the disease . Immunity may not even be reliable for this virus. Worse, it did not take into account that the duration of hospitalisation can be lengthier than they think, or that one can incur a shortage of hospital beds . Second, but more grave, is the policymaking. No 10 appears to be enamoured with \u201cscientism\u201d \u2013 things that have the cosmetic attributes of science but without its rigour. This manifests itself in the nudge group that engages in experimenting with UK citizens or applying methods from behavioural economics that fail to work outside the university \u2013 yet patronise citizens as an insult to their ancestral wisdom and risk-perception apparatus. Social science is in a \u201creplication crisis\u201d, where less than half the results replicate (under exact same conditions), less than a tenth can be taken seriously, and less than a hundredth translate into the real world. UK coronavirus live: 12,000 former NHS workers to return and emergency hospital to open\u00a0as death toll rises Read more So what is called \u201cevidence-based\u201d methods have a dire track record and are pretty much evidence-free. This scientism also manifests itself in Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings\u2019s love of complexity and complex systems (our speciality) which he appears to apply incorrectly. And letting a segment of the population die for the sake of the economy is a false dichotomy \u2013 aside from the moral repugnance of the idea. As we said, when one deals with deep uncertainty, both governance and precaution require us to hedge for the worst. While risk-taking is a business that is left to individuals, collective safety and systemic risk are the business of the state. Failing that mandate of prudence by gambling with the lives of citizens is a professional wrongdoing that extends beyond academic mistake; it is a violation of the ethics of governing. The obvious policy left now is a lockdown, with overactive testing and contact tracing: follow the evidence from China and South Korea rather than thousands of error-prone computer codes. So we have wasted weeks, and ones that matter with a multiplicative threat. \u2022 Nassim Nicholas Taleb is distinguished professor of risk engineering at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and author of The Black Swan.

As the days spent in our homes blur together and become indistinguishable, outside in the world huge shifts in consciousness are happening. Just as it was unimaginable that things could go back to normal after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, so it is that policy, investments and our collective imaginations over the coming years will be overshadowed by a virus that took fewer than 100 days to shut the world down. These strange months may be the first of an era defined by hyper-awareness of the threat posed by pandemics. It is too soon to say what that will look like. Each day brings shocks and possibilities, illuminates a little more of our new reality. Epidemiologists will study the past five months for decades; historians even longer. But already we can see the rough contours forming. We are learning what works against Covid-19. And, surveying the wreckage of the third coronavirus to become an epidemic this century \u2013 along with two animal influenzas and several waves of Ebola \u2013 lessons are emerging about the kinds of societies that will be required to withstand the future outbreaks that scientists tell us are inevitable, and increasing. You must move fast Facebook Twitter Pinterest Officials use thermal scanners to screen passengers arriving in Taiwan on a flight from Wuhan in January. Photograph: Chen Chi-Chuan/AFP/Getty Images China announced the discovery of a \u201cpneumonia of unknown origin\u201d on the afternoon of 31 December. The announcement barely registered in a world preparing to celebrate the end of the decade. But that same day in Taiwan, the government in Taipei ordered any planes arriving from Wuhan to remain on the tarmac so airport staff could inspect the health of all those onboard. China resisted implementing country-wide health screenings or taking temperature readings in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for the next fortnight, even as doctors in the city were reporting floods of patients struggling to breathe, and as leaders in Beijing became aware they were confronting \u201cthe most severe challenge\u201d since Sars . In the meantime, Taiwan\u2019s Centers for Disease Control was monitoring arrivals from Wuhan, quarantining any person with a fever or cough and urging its citizens to avoid any unnecessary travel to Hubei. In China cases would have been cut by 95% acting three weeks earlier A study released in March underlined the importance of acting fast. Had China implemented widespread testing, a cordon sanitaire around Hubei and other measures a week earlier, it would have reduced China\u2019s caseload by 66%, the researchers argued. Acting three weeks earlier would have cut cases by 95%. As of this week, Taiwan has confirmed 429 positive coronavirus cases and six deaths. The lesson for governments was underlined by Michael Ryan, a surgeon and the executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s health emergencies programme, in a press conference in March . \u201cBe fast. Have no regrets. You must be the first mover. The virus will always get you if you don\u2019t move quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you need to be right before you move, you will never win \u2026 Speed trumps perfection.\u201d We know what works to contain it \u2026 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Workers queue for coronavirus tests at a temporary facility in Seoul in South Korea. Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images Months into this epidemic, even basic information about the coronavirus is still unclear. How infectious is it? How deadly? Leaders make life-and-death decisions based on best guesses. \u201cWe are flying the plane as it\u2019s being built,\u201d says Ashley Arabasadi, a policy adviser at the US-based institute Management Sciences for Health. Yet the basic principles for containing a disease, developed and refined with reference to hundreds of previous epidemics, have held true for Covid-19. \u201cThe successful examples and failed examples in containing the spread of the virus have something in common,\u201d says Yanzhong Huang, the director of the Centre for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University in the US. The countries that have implemented early and extensive testing, such as South Korea and Iceland, have been able to keep their societies relatively open, without loosing the virus into their populations. Singapore kept a lid on its initial wave by diligently retracing the steps of people who tested positive for Covid-19. Those they came into sustained contact with were often put in home isolation, with harsh penalties for breaking it. The sick were quarantined in hospitals, even if their symptoms were mild. When containing cases is no longer possible, early evidence from Europe shows that physical distancing measures, implemented early, \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and reduce the overall size of a country\u2019s outbreak. \u201cIrrespective of the society, the level of development, the preparedness of the health system, early lockdown worked in containing the epidemic, whereas a late lockdown led to a massive outbreak,\u201d says Joel Ruet, the president of the Bridge Tank thinktank, which conducted the research. \u2026 the hard part is implementing it Facebook Twitter Pinterest Police patrol a roadblock in Guardamiglio in northern Italy. Guardamiglio was placed under lockdown after infections spread throughout the Lombardy region. Photograph: Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images In 2014, as Ebola was spreading in west Africa, Rebecca Katz remembers hearing frustrations from some of the countries helping to fund the response. \u201cThey would be asking things like: \u2018How dare Sierra Leone not close schools during an Ebola outbreak?\u2019\u201d says the director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center. \u201cFor a long time it\u2019s been easy for donor countries to cast judgment on recipient countries for their behaviour in disease transmission.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak has made clear that it is a universal problem: even countries that know what works, and have the capacity to act, still hesitate. Some with strong liberal traditions, such as Britain, balked initially at the prospect of drastically curbing civil rights. Italian industry groups are reported to have strongly resisted the idea of shutting down Lombardy, one of the engines of the country\u2019s economy. Developing countries such as Pakistan have had to balance slowing the spread of the disease with the disastrous consequences of closing the farms and construction sites where the poorest work. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy for me to say, hey, we should institute social distancing measures and close schools and cut the link between those susceptible to the disease and the infectious,\u201d says Katz. \u201cKnowing what the larger societal impact is makes it harder to pull the trigger.\u201d There were blind spots in the way countries prepared. A global index released in October concluded the US was more ready than anywhere else to fight a pandemic. But the scorecard, based on WHO methodology, focused more on technical capacity than government processes, says Alexandra Phelan, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center. Official figures show the US has had the largest and most deadly outbreak, exacerbated by a slow initial response, mismanagement of testing and poor coordination between states and the federal government . \u201cAs this outbreak has demonstrated, you can have the best labs in the world, the best notification systems and software, but if you don\u2019t have the appropriate governance of when to use these powers \u2026 they don\u2019t function,\u201d Phelan says. Civil liberties face their greatest test in a generation Facebook Twitter Pinterest A drone used by Indian police for surveillance in Bhopal during lockdown. Photograph: Sanjeev Gupta/EPA Digital surveillance tools that might have been closely scrutinised in normal times have been urgently rolled out over recent weeks. More than 40 countries have implemented some form of surveillance or censorship in the name of fighting the coronavirus, according to one estimate . These tools have created a world that might have appeared dystopian a few months ago. In Hong Kong and Bahrain, people in quarantine are being issued with electronic bracelets that track their movements. Drones equipped with cameras hover over some Indian neighbourhoods warning residents they are being watched. Israel has revealed it has secretly been amassing people\u2019s phone data and is tapping that database to find potential coronavirus cases. \"Drones equipped with cameras hover over some Indian neighbourhoods warning residents they are being watched\" South Korea credited its advanced use of technology with helping to uncover clusters of cases that would otherwise have gone undetected. About 81% of Koreans approve of the surveillance measures there, according to one poll. Human rights advocates acknowledge we are living through an emergency, but worry governments will use fears of future outbreaks to justify keeping many of these tools in place \u2013 whether or not they help. \u201cWe are facing an immense challenge, but necessity is the question,\u201d says Akshaya Kumar, the director of crisis advocacy at Human Rights Watch. \u201cSome of these measures are just peering into people\u2019s lives and taking power without a clear sunset clause, and without a sense that they\u2019re really needed to combat the virus.\u201d \u201cThe potential for abuse is high,\u201d the UN warned in a report last week . \u201cWhat is justified during an emergency now may become normalised once the crisis has passed.\u201d Public trust is a government\u2019s most valuable asset. The next months will strain it Facebook Twitter Pinterest Suspects are arrested for defying the lockdown during an operation in Johannesburg in South Africa. Photograph: Michele Spatari/AFP /Getty Images There is no precedent for half the world\u2019s population living under some kind of lockdown. It might just be the single largest collective act undertaken by humanity. Its successful execution requires extraordinary public trust in their governments, says Lars Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh, a Swedish historian who studies trust in institutions over time. \u201cIf you trust the government is working for your good, and you trust other citizens to follow the rules, you have huge advantages for collective action,\u201d he says. Mobility in Sweden\u2019s parks and gardens In places where trust in government is weak, fear has worked to clear the streets. In South Africa, police used whips to enforce a national curfew. Indian migrant labourers walking home were made to squat and crawl as punishment for being outside, while in Jordan, more than 1,600 people were imprisoned in the first three days of quarantine. But restrictions implemented in low-trust societies could engender a backlash, says Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what happening in Southern Europe and the US right now where you see a lot of disobedience.\u201d Over the next months, governments are going to allow people to resume their lives amid the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression. Should new waves of the virus be detected, states may again ask their citizens to return home. Managing this is going to require significant stores of public trust, that in some places are quickly eroding. \u201cIf people agree to do something in the long term, without a threat hanging over their heads, they are more likely to keep doing it,\u201d Tr\u00e4g\u00e5rdh says. \u201cThe alternative is fear, distrust, and chaos, and that isn\u2019t good, no matter what the policy might be.\u201d Leaders who deny science are a liability Facebook Twitter Pinterest Slogans denouncing Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s response to the pandemic are projected on to a building in S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil. Photograph: Amanda Perobelli/Reuters Many leaders have enjoyed what may be a temporary surge in popularity as frightened citizens rally around them in a crisis. Two notable exceptions have been the US president, Donald Trump, and his Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, whose ratings have declined sharply . Both men, rightwing populists who frame their presidencies as revolts against the elites, including scientific authorities, have been highly skilled at influencing the media environment. But the coronavirus is a unique test. It spreads and kills regardless of how it is being framed online or in the media. It emphasises the importance of experts. Success depends on rallying the country together. Retail and recreation mobility \u201cLeaders such as Trump deploy simple messages: insider versus outsider, us versus them,\u201d says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor at Temple University in the US, who studies the politics of information. \u201cAnd they are having an ideological crisis in how to manage the message here. This is a very complicated information sphere, which you can\u2019t put into \u2018us and them\u2019 boxes \u2026 because in this case everybody is the \u2018us\u2019.\u201d Rather than rewarding bravado, the moment appears to favour leaders who can be honest about the uncertainty inherent in fighting a virus, says Kathleen Bachynski, an assistant professor of public health at Muhlenberg College. \u201cIf leaders are not willing or able to be honest about these limitations, there will be this loss of credibility \u2013 and it won\u2019t be because they are wrong, it\u2019s because information is changing.\u201d Those overseeing some of the more successful responses, such as Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel or Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, have been praised for their ability to project empathy and communicate complex ideas. Asked to explain Germany\u2019s metrics for deciding when to ease the lockdown, Merkel fluently explained the need to bring down the \u201creproducibility number\u201d of the virus so that the health system can cope with its continued spread. In a press conference a few days earlier, Trump answered the same question by pointing to his head. \u201cThe metrics right here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my metrics.\u201d The responses to the virus in both Brazil and the US are increasingly being led by state leaders, who are bypassing the federal government and coordinating directly with each other. Self-sufficiency matters again \u2026 Facebook Twitter Pinterest Soldiers prepare to load a military cargo plane with personal protective equipment donated by Turkey to help the US. Photograph: AP Governments will not soon forget the desperate global scramble for personal protective equipment and medical supplies they have engaged in these past months. Nor the sight of doctors and nurses forced to guard against infection using bin bags and homemade masks. Several countries have already restricted the exporting of some pharmaceuticals and more than a dozen have imposed bans on selling some food abroad. The UN has warned that if quarantines persist, food supply chains in some places might start to be disrupted from this month. Baseline mobility in grocery areas The message is being received. EU countries are emphasising the importance of increasing the \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d of the bloc and ensuring it produces its own essential goods. Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, told village leaders last week the most important lesson from the pandemic was the need for self-reliance. \u201cWe should not look to other countries to satisfy our needs,\u201d he said. Australia is one of several countries said to be re-examining the exposure of food, fuel and medical supplies in particular to global supply chains, the fragility of which have been exposed. \u2026 but the world cannot beat the virus without cooperating Facebook Twitter Pinterest A transmission electron microscope image of the coronavirus. Photograph: NIAID-RML/Reuters The coronavirus got lucky: it emerged at a low point for global cooperation. Countries recognised after Sars that sharing information, coordinating responses and pooling resources such as protective gear, medicine and tests was vital. A set of international regulations that came into force in 2007 laid the groundwork for this cooperation. As Covid-19 started to spread, the regulations were virtually ignored. \u201cThe biggest surprise was how quickly the plans were not at all consulted,\u201d Katz says. \u201cThe world was quick to throw out the global governance tools we had so carefully negotiated.\u201d The lack of cooperation has weakened the world\u2019s response, public health experts argue. A global stimulus package might have put a floor under the economic catastrophe unfolding in many countries. Coordinated shutdowns and reopenings would have slowed the spread of the virus and could speed up the recovery. We might have avoided chaos in the global market for medical and protective equipment, with reports of the US waving wads of cash to re-divert planeloads of masks bound for France, and Israel running clandestine spy operations to source testing kits. \u201cThe last four years have seen a profound shift to governments that are protectionist and nationalistic and who argue the multilateral system doesn\u2019t benefit them,\u201d Phelan says. \u201cThose of us who work in global health or other international problems know we\u2019re interconnected. That global problems required global solutions.\u201d Austerity and inequality make us less resilient Facebook Twitter Pinterest A worker makes scrubs for frontline NHS staff in O\u2019Neills sportswear factory in Strabane in Northern Ireland. Photograph: Paul Faith/AFP/Getty Images No economy could withstand the shock of a large slice of the workforce suddenly ordered home. But the virus has irradiated weaknesses that have made the outbreak deadlier, and will make its aftermath hurt more. The problems with tying health insurance to employment in the US have become even more obvious: the 26 million Americans who have filed for benefits over the past month did not just lose their jobs, many also lost their medical coverage. Britain has the NHS, but a decade of austerity had weakened the system and left the country in demonstrably worse health when the virus struck. The rise of precarious gig-economy jobs and zero-hours contracts has created a mass of workers without access to sick and paid leave, incentivising some to keep working when the entire community needs them to stay home. Insecure work and barriers to healthcare disproportionately burden people from ethnic minorities and poor people: both are dying from Covid-19 at a higher rate in the US and Britain . Governments that have spent decades scaling back social welfare systems are now scrambling to build new ones on the fly. \u201cThe world is realising that there are many millions of workers who have fallen through the cracks of the existing social protection systems,\u201d says Luca Pellerano, a senior social protection specialist with the International Labour Organisation. \u201cThey are not in forms of protected employment, yet they are not poor enough to fall into the often quite narrow and shallow [existing] anti-poverty programmes. Countries with very fragile systems, with big coverage gaps, are scrambling to find solutions and are clearly behind the curve.\u201d The poor and migrants cannot be invisible Facebook Twitter Pinterest Foreign workers wait to be transferred from their dormitory in Singapore after an outbreak among migrant workers. Photograph: Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images Singapore\u2019s response has been lauded as a model. Its government moved fast, utilising technology, exemplary public communication and the traditional tools of outbreak control to corral its first wave of cases to about 200. Then last week, it announced it had discovered thousands of new infections, almost all of them among migrant workers living in dormitories on industrial estates on the outskirts of the sleek city-state. Rights groups say little attention was paid to the more than 1 million migrant workers, even as restrictions on crowding and movement were rolled out. Viruses can see the people who are usually invisible to policymakers and the public. The conditions in which they work and live are everyone\u2019s problem. The same is true of the residents of Dharavi, a Mumbai slum where almost 1 million people are crammed together within sight of the skyscrapers and penthouses apartments of some of the wealthiest people in Asia. More than 200 cases have been discovered so far . City authorities acknowledge it will be virtually impossible to halt the spread of the disease among these communities. \u201cTen to 15 people stay in one room,\u201d one official, Kiran Dighavkar, told New Delhi Television last week. \u201cHow is it possible to enforce social distancing?\u201d Topics Infectious diseases Population Surveillance features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most popular World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

To help outlets get back on their feet\nand encourage Kiwi consumers to support local, DB Breweries\nhas announced a million dollar support package, dubbed\n\u2018Back Your Bar\u2019. The Back Your Bar package\nincludes: \u00b7 A practical online support portal \u2013 backyourbar.co.nz . This\nis open for the whole industry, not just DB customers, and\nincludes detailed information about the considerations\nrequired to operate in the current climate \u00b7 A full\nmedia campaign to drive awareness and foot traffic to local\noutlets \u00b7 DB customer support including stock bundles\nand advertising materials for outlets to communicate with\ncustomers The Back Your Bar programme will provide\nmore than $1million worth of value and provide hospitality\noperators with the support they need to responsibly\nreconnect with their patrons after the lockdown\nperiod. Paul Millward, Sales Director, DB Breweries,\nknows this support is going to have a huge\nimpact: \u201cHospitality is a special industry where we\nall have amazing memories over the years. Incredible,\nhardworking owners and their staff put their hearts and\nsouls into these businesses and operating at Alert Level 2\nand beyond will not be easy. We wanted to help both the\nwider industry, and do a little extra for our customers, to\nhelp them survive now and thrive later. Bars need life so\nget out there and catch up with mates. \u201cDespite all\nthe new ways of connecting, nothing beats sitting down with\nreal people and having a meal you didn\u2019t have to cook with\na cold beer, so we hope Kiwis get behind Back Your Bar and\nsupport their local so they are there in the future. We\u2019re\nproud to play a role in supporting this.\u201d The media\ncampaign to encourage people to support their local launches\ntomorrow. The television ad is set to the Simple Minds track\n\"Don't You Forget About Me,\" and spells out the lyrics to\nthe song with footage of deserted outlets \u2013 but with a\npositive spin. The ad encourages patrons to support their\nlocals when they are safely able to visit again. A\nsignificant media spend package will see the ad run on TV\nand digital throughout the coming weeks. The online\nsupport portal \u2013 www.backyourbar.co.nz \u2013 is live now and will be updated regularly. It offers all\nkinds of assistance, including information about: \u00b7\nWhere to get Government support \u00b7 How to prepare a\nvenue for patrons \u00b7 Health and safety\ninformation \u00b7 Legal material \u00b7 Shareable\ndigital assets \u00b7 Digital engagement tips \u00b7\nInformation about Mentemia, Sir John Kirwan\u2019s mental\nwellbeing app (DB is a proud foundation partner of\nMentemia) The support portal also includes details of\na partnership between DB Breweries and law firm Dentons\nKensington Swan to support businesses with the legal\nrequirements arising from the lockdown and COVID-19. There\nare two resource hubs on their website aimed at assisting\npeople with legal issues and providing information\nspecifically related to COVID-19 and what\u2019s to come for\nNew Zealand businesses. On top of this, DB hospitality\noutlets are able to access a complimentary 15-minute\ndiscussion with a lawyer from the firm regarding any\nCOVID-related legal issues. DB Breweries customers are\nset to benefit most from the initiative, with a range of\ncommercial support in the form of stock bundles and a point\nof sale suite. Julie White, Chief Executive Officer,\nHospitality New Zealand, is delighted with the support\npackage: \u201cThe hospitality industry is undoubtedly\none of the hardest hit as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDB\u2019s Back Your Bar initiative is a fantastic package to\nsupport the industry, ultimately helping to protect\nlivelihoods and keep this beloved part of our social fabric\noperating.

One measure under consideration is a share sale equal to as much as 20% of the company\u2019s issued capital, they said.An offering could be announced as early as this month, the people said. No final decisions have been made, and Coventry, England-based Meggitt may also choose not to proceed with a transaction, they said.Meggitt said in a statement Thursday that it continues to review actions to mitigate any further downturn in the industry. It said liquidity remains strong, with headroom of 856 million pounds ($1.1 billion) at the end of June and eligibility to access Britain\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility if required.The company makes components for an aerospace industry that\u2019s been hit hard by the pandemic. Airlines have seen revenue evaporate amid restrictions on global travel, and a number of Meggitt\u2019s clients, including Boeing Co., Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and Honeywell International Inc., have sought additional funding to shore up their balance sheets.Jefferies International analyst Sandy Morris said in a note that an equity raise may be the most likely option for the company, \u201cdesigned primarily to enable Meggitt to seize opportunities more than to repair the balance sheet.\u201dShares SlumpThe stock traded 6.1% lower at 277.30 pence as of 1:54 p.m. in London, extending its decline this year to 58% and giving a market value of 2.16 billion pounds.

According to the most recent statement it had about 1.7 billion pounds of committed facilities in place at the end of June.U.K.-listed companies have been given extra leeway to raise larger amounts of new equity amid the downturn. The country\u2019s financial standard-setters recommended in April that shareholders support companies that want to sell new stock equal to as much as 20% of their issued capital -- double the usual ceiling.Firms including Informa Plc, Compass Group Plc and Asos Plc have sold about 14.4 billion pounds in additional equity since then, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, a more than threefold increase from the same period in 2019.

Simply Wall St July 11, 2020 To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Firstly, we\u2019ll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it\u2019s a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, Barco ( EBR:BAR ) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital. What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? If you haven\u2019t worked with ROCE before, it measures the \u2018return\u2019 (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Barco is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities) 0.12 = \u20ac106m \u00f7 (\u20ac1.2b \u2013 \u20ac316m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2019) . So, Barco has an ROCE of 12%. In absolute terms, that\u2019s a satisfactory return, but compared to the Electronic industry average of 9.7% it\u2019s much better. See our latest analysis for Barco ENXTBR:BAR Return on Capital Employed July 11th 2020 Above you can the how the current ROCE for Barco\u2019s compares to it\u2019s prior returns on capital, but you can only tell so much from the past. If you\u2019d like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Barco here for free. What Can We Tell From Barco\u2019s ROCE Trend? Investors would be pleased with what\u2019s happening at Barco. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 12%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 30%. This can indicate that there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that\u2019s common among multi-baggers. In another part of our analysis, we noticed that the company\u2019s ratio of current liabilities to total assets decreased to 27%, which broadly means the business is relying less on its suppliers or short-term creditors to fund its operations. So this improvement in ROCE has come from the business\u2019 underlying economics, which is great to see. The Bottom Line On Barco\u2019s ROCE A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that\u2019s what Barco has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 177% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence. While Barco looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

COVID-19 Pandemic Likely To Cause US Telemedicine Boom 1 Jul, 2020 US companies hoarding cash seen dragging on recovery until coronavirus beaten Author Peter Brennan Theme Real Estate Technology, Media & Telecom Fintech Macroeconomics The Dash for Cash: This story is the third of a three-part series examining the changing shape of company balance sheets in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Don't rely on companies to drag the U.S. economy out of its coronavirus-induced slump. The Dash for Cash Part 1: Weakest US companies led dash for cash as coronavirus came over the horizon Part 2: Prudence pays as cash-rich US companies outperform peers in 2020 Part 3: US companies hoarding cash seen dragging on recovery until coronavirus beaten After U.S. companies built up their cash buffers to multiyear highs to guard against pandemic-related uncertainty, capital expenditure \u2014 the second-largest chunk of the U.S. economy after consumer spending \u2014 is predicted to suffer, acting as a drag on the recovery. Cash ratios \u2014 a measure of liquidity calculated by dividing total cash or cash equivalents by current liabilities \u2014 among S&P 500 members jumped to 17.1% in the first quarter from 13.8% at the end of last year as companies increased their cash holdings by $250 billion to a record $1.8 trillion, according to calculations by S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Dow Jones Indices. U.S. companies have been carrying more cash ever since the global financial crisis of 2008 as CFOs remained wary of future shocks. Now, analysts are pondering the long-term effects on company balance sheets of this unprecedented economic trauma. \"[Cash ratios] will stay like this for some time particularly while the virus is still out there and the threat of an extended first wave or second wave are very much a risk,\" Toby Gibb, head of investment directing, equities at Fidelity International, said in an interview. \"Until there is a vaccine, the risk is very much there that we could go back to lockdowns and that cash flow could be switched off.\" There is evidence that the shift has already started, compounded by a slump in demand and disruptions to supply chains. Demand for core durable goods \u2014 a key indicator of capital expenditure in the manufacturing sector that excludes fluctuating goods such as aircraft \u2014 slumped in April, with new orders down 6.5% month on month from $65.61 billion to $61.34 billion, a three-year low and the sharpest month-on-month decline since April 2010. Shipments fell 6.2% from $65.3 billion to $61.25 billion in April, the sharpest decline since January 2009. There was a rebound of sorts in May with orders and shipments increasing by 2.3% and 1.8%, respectively, but levels remain well below the pre-pandemic normal. By pumping trillions of dollars into financial markets, the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury have effectively supported liquidity, allowing companies access to cheap credit. However, there are doubts as to how long that support will be there and whether borrowing will become more expensive. Lawmakers are sparring over what measures to include in a second stimulus package and the Federal Reserve's $600 billion Main Street lending program is yet to disburse any payments. \"Main street program interest rates are too high,\" Simon MacAdam, senior global economist at Capital Economics, said in an interview . \"There has been poor take up in some government schemes so there are some question marks of access to funds if cash ratios do fall.\" Rather than rely on government largess, companies have been hitting debt markets like never before to buff up their balance sheets. Investment grade companies borrowed a record $1.129 trillion in the bond market in the first six months of 2020 while their speculative-grade peers raised an all-time high $210.6 billion, according to LCD, an offering of S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"In the short term it's still liquidity that is the concern,\" MacAdam said. \"[The] medium-term concern is whether that holds back the recovery because, rather than funding capex, they're just concerned about multiple waves.\" While there are estimated to be around 100 vaccines in development with a number in human trials, the earliest that one is likely to be widely available is in 2021, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The danger for the economy is that the decision to hoard cash and not invest becomes self-fulling, said Neil Richardson, investment director at Aberdeen Standard. \"If corporate confidence is low and they don't invest then it will produce low growth, which will make them think they were correct not to invest,\" he said in an interview. Declining capex U.S. companies have been investing less for decades, in many cases juicing valuations with dividends and buybacks instead. Capex as a percentage of GDP was 21% in 2018, down from over 25% in the mid-1980s, according to the World Bank. However, the pandemic may change that equation as companies shift priorities in the new reality, according to Fidelity's Gibb. \"We've been in a period for a long period of time where companies haven't been investing, they've been using their cash flow either to pay dividends or buyback their own shares,\" Gibb said. \"At the least maintenance capex and a degree of growth capex will remain. I think some companies see this as an opportunity to reset the bar from a dividends perspective.\" Author Peter Brennan Theme Real Estate Technology, Media & Telecom Fintech Macroeconomics About Us Quality Program Contact Us Email Subscription Center Press Releases Careers Corporate Responsibility Our History Investor Relations Leadership \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Terms of Use Cookie Notice Privacy Policy Disclosures Do Not Sell My Personal Information"},

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is seeking court clarification on whether insurers\u2019 policies allow them to refuse business claims related to the coronavirus pandemic. The hearing is scheduled for late July. The majority of small businesses were not covered for the pandemic , as their policies mainly related to property damage, the regulator believes. However, after the regulator asked 56 insurers for information on 1 May, an undisclosed number quickly gave in and said they would pay out, after previously insisting they were not liable. In a statement on Monday the FCA said: \u201cA number of the relevant insurers decided to accept claims\u00a0from policyholders with certain policies which included particular wordings which had previously been in dispute.\u201d The test case in the high court will look at 17 representative policy wordings, while eight insurers will be defendants. They are Arch Insurance, Argenta Syndicate Management, Ecclesiastical Insurance Office, Hiscox, MS Amlin Underwriting, QBE, Royal & Sun Alliance, and Zurich. Policies from Allianz, American International Group (AIG), Aspen, Aviva, Axa, Chubb, Liberty Mutual and Protector also include the wording to be tested in court. The FCA will detail in early July which other companies will also be covered by the eventual ruling. Insurers\u2019 refusal to pay out claims after years of expensive premiums has prompted anger from businesses, although the Association of British Insurers (ABI) estimated that the industry will still pay out \u00a3900m in business disruption claims . A group of nightclubs, bars and clubs is suing Hiscox over its non-payment. Michael Kill, the chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said in April insurers were using \u201ccontrived arguments to avoid sharing the financial burden during the Covid-19 crisis\u201d. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The ABI declined to comment on Monday. Christopher Woolard, the interim chief executive of the FCA, said identifying the test policies was \u201ca major step forward in progressing the matter to court\u201d. \u201cThe court action we are taking is aimed at providing clarity and certainty for everyone involved in these [business interruption] disputes, policyholder and insurer alike. We feel it is also the quickest route to this clarity and by covering multiple policies and insurers, it will also be of most use across the market,\u201d he said.

The action concerns alleged use of so-called \"defeat devices\" to mask vehicles' diesel pollution output. Engines used by Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep, as well as CNH's Iveco trucks are the focus of the probe. UK authorities have also asked two firms in London to provide documents. Fiat-Chrysler Automobile (FCA) and CNH Industrial (CNH) are both controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family. Lawsuit alleges defeat devices in Nissan petrol cars Volkswagen loses landmark German 'dieselgate' case A statement from Eurojust, a European Union agency for criminal cooperation across member states, said the probe is looking into a \"number of people\" who may have been involved in allegedly allowing use of the devices. It did not name them. The raids, initiated by German prosecutors investigating emissions fraud, involve claims that defeat devices were used in engine management software in 200,000 vehicles. Use of software to flatter emissions levels hit the headlines over the Volkswagen \"diselegate\" affair. Defeat devices allow engines to meet pollution levels under laboratory tests, but shut down the emissions control system in real-world driving conditions. UK documents Eurojust did not name the companies raided. However, FCA and CNH issued similar statements, acknowledging that investigators had turned up at several offices in Europe, and that they are cooperating fully with authorities. Eurojust also said that \"UK authorities have ordered two companies in London to produce relevant documents\". Again, these companies were not named. The statement said: \"Defeat devices are illegal according to the European Union regulations in place. Vehicles with defeat devices are not approved for road usage in the EU and consumers with such devices installed in their cars face possible driving bans.\" Wednesday's raids were at three offices in Germany, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse, three locations in the Piedmont region of Italy, and one location in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. The VW dieselgate scandal broke in 2015, since when Europe's biggest carmaker has paid out \u20ac30bn (\u00a327bn) in fines and been investigated by regulators across the world. In the UK, motorists are involved in legal action for compensation . But VW is far from the only manufacture caught in claims about defeat devices. Nissan, Ford, and Daimler are among many firms whose true emissions levels have been challenged.

The Frankton Hotel in the Hamilton central\ncity-fringe industrial suburb of Frankton sits near a site\nfirst occupied by The Railway Hotel built in 1878. The\nRailway Hotel burnt down in 1885 and was replaced with what\nhas gone on to become the Frankton Hotel. The hotel was\noriginally located directly opposite what was Frankton\nJunction station until the depot was relocated several\nhundred metres west in the 1930s. Continuously modified\nand expanded over the ensuing decades, the current Art Deco\nstyled Frankton Hotel structure was completed in 1929, with\nminor alterations and extensions made in 1943, 1956, and the\n1970s. The land and buildings are owned by former All Black\nfront rower Graham \u2018Moose\u2019 Whiting who played 31 matches\nfor the ABs in the early 1970s. The historic pub overlooks\nHamilton\u2019s railway lines and sidings - part of the main\ntrunk line linking Auckland with the Central North Island\nand Wellington routes. Since the turn of the last century,\nthe main trunk rail line running through Frankton has been\nthe spine for freight movements around the North Island \u2013\ntransporting primary produce such as sheep and beef meat\nbutchered at the Horotiu freezing works, logs from the\nCentral North Island forests, and coal from the Huntly\nmines. As the closest \u2018watering hole\u2019 to the rail\nyards, the Frankton Hotel was a natural after-work venue for\nthe hundreds of men who worked in the sidings, goods sheds,\nengineering workshops and passenger services over the\ndecades. Because of its axis position and trunk line linking\nup to the Bay of Plenty and the Port of Tauranga, the\nFrankton Junction railyards were among the busiest in New\nZealand. Now the Frankton Hotel freehold land and building\nat 40 High Street are being marketed for sale by tender\nthrough Bayleys Hamilton, with the tender process closing on\nJune 25. Just the Frankton Hotel land and buildings, and not\nthe hospitality business operating inside, are being offered\nfor sale. Bayleys Hamilton salesperson Josh Smith said\nthat while the two-storey character venue on the corner of\nCommercial Street was built on servicing the needs of rail\nworkers from a bygone era, rail was also the cornerstone of\nthe venue\u2019s future. \u201cThe pub is located some 200\nmetres from Hamilton train station \u2013 which is about to\nenter a new era as it connects the city to Auckland with a\ncommuter rail service,\u201d Mr Smith said. \u201cThis new\niteration will add to the pub\u2019s existing clientele base -\nbeing the preferred licensed hospitality operation for the\nthousands of factory floor workers employed in the light\nindustrial businesses and engineering firms in the\nsurrounding Frankton area. \u201cIn addition to these patron\ndemographic target markets, the Frankton Hotel will be\nconveniently located just a short walk from the 75-unit\nRawhiti Village residential development project which is\nspearheading the gentrification of the Frankton area.\nHamilton CBD is just a 1.6 kilometre walk away. \u201cThe\npathway toward re-inventing the Frankton Hotel as a\nhospitality entity appealing to different market sectors is\nalready underway \u2013 with the Ministry for Culture and\nHeritage already signing an agreement with the current\nowners to fund $40,000 worth of refurbishment and structural\nengineering and design plans for the venue.\u201d The 1,580\nsquare metre dual level Frankton Hotel premises sit on some\n1,618 square metres of flat freehold land \u2013 and are leased\nto the venue\u2019s hospitality business tenants until 2024\nwith three further six-year rights of renewal generating\nannual rental of $104,000 plus GST and outgoings. Various\nportions of the hotel have new building standards ratings of\nbetween 25 \u2013 85 percent. Mr Smith said The Frankton\nHotel\u2019s hospitality service options encompassed two bars,\ntwo function rooms, accommodation options on the upper\nlevel, a TAB sports betting space, and an 18-machine gaming\nroom. Accommodation amenities at the hotel comprise 16 rooms\n\u2013 configured into queen/twin and triple bedrooms and two\nbackpacker dorms, with a nightly rack rate of $80 for the\nindividual rooms. \u201cThe multiple existing bar and meeting\nroom spaces within the High Street/Commercial Street\nproperty would allow any new owner of the Frankton Hotel to\nlook at upgrading the greater premises with a view to\nretaining but modernising the \u2018public\u2019 bar servicing the\nlocal working clientele, and simultaneously creating a\nseparate more upmarket bar/restaurant amenity to cater for a\nwhite-collar and family-orientated customer base,\u201d Mr\nSmith\nsaid. \u00a9 Scoop Media Bayleys Real Estate New Zealand Bayleys is New Zealand's largest full-service real estate company.

Stocks have surged more than 40% since late March because the worst damage from the coronavirus recession is in the past and the cavalry has arrived. The Federal Reserve is now propping up risky assets, Congress is flooding the economy with money and some of the millions of lost jobs seem to be returning . But if you\u2019re an ordinary person who thinks the soaring stock market is crazy , you\u2019re right. There\u2019s no right or wrong value for any stock, or for the market as a whole. There\u2019s only the value the market assigns at any point in time, based on supply, demand and other factors. But demand for stocks\u2014investors placing buy orders\u2014is out of sync with what\u2019s happening in the real economy, where the unemployment rate has soared from 3.5% to 13.3% in just three months. Traders are right when they say the stock market evaluates the future, not the past. Backward-looking economic data about what happened last week or last month is irrelevant to the value of stocks unless it hints at future actions, such as an unexpected change in Federal Reserve policy. But it\u2019s hard to imagine what future stocks are evaluating right now. 2025? 2030? \u00a0If so, that\u2019s a time horizon so distant it\u2019s almost meaningless. Here are some of the grim developments economists foresee during the next 12 to 24 months: Massive small business failures. \u201c Very small businesses with just a few em\u00adployees are expected to fail en masse,\u201d Moody\u2019s Analytics says in a June 2 forecast . \u201cOf the 8 million busi\u00adness establishments operating prior to the crisis in the U.S., it would not be surprising if close to a million do not make it. New busi\u00adnesses will eventually form, and the economy will recover, but that process will take years, not months.\u201d Many of those small firms don\u2019t have the connection with banks needed to take advantage of federal aid. Commercial bankruptcy filings in May soared by 48% year over year, a preview of the carnage coming. Trillions in lost output. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the coronavirus recession will cost the U.S. economy $15.7 trillion in real economic output by 2030, adjusted for inflation, for a 5.3% drop in total output. That\u2019s 7 months\u2019 worth of economic activity that simply won\u2019t happen, which will suppress employment and incomes well into the decade. View photos The May jobs report showed an unexpected rise in non-farm payrolls (David Foster/Yahoo Finance) More A long and slow jobs recovery . IHS Markit thinks employment won\u2019t recover to pre-virus levels until 2024, even with the surprise addition of 2.5 million new jobs in May. Those May job gains reflect some furloughed workers returning in hammered industries such as travel and retail. But statistical anomalies in the government survey may have left some jobless workers uncounted. And employment can\u2019t recover fully until there\u2019s a coronavirus vaccine, which is probably a year away at the earliest. Congress, meanwhile, may decline to pass further stimulus measures, which many economists think are still needed. One month of upbeat job numbers could turn out to be a mirage. Debt crises. Governments everywhere are racking up debt to bail out companies and workers and keep the global recession from getting worse. At some point, serious doubts will rise about some countries\u2019 ability to make interest payments. It\u2019ll happen first in developing countries and then perhaps in Italy. Rising interest rates would be one ugly manifestation, pushing up borrowing costs for everybody. Bank stress. Many businesses that fail or restructure will default on debt owed to banks and other lenders. Banks aren\u2019t fragile and overleveraged as they were before the financial crash in 2008, but an unforeseen shock of the magnitude we\u2019re seeing now could bring down at least a few lenders. Story continues Investors clearly think the Fed and other central banks can corral these problems, and the Fed certainly has the power to massively intervene in the economy. What the Fed can\u2019t do, however, is create demand. That requires businesses and consumers to gain confidence that the coronavirus is gone for good, jobs are safe and it\u2019s okay to spend money. View photos In this March 3, 2020 file photo, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference to discuss an announcement from the Federal Open Market Committee, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) More Most states are now easing stay-home restrictions meant to stop the spread of the virus, and economic activity is slowly bouncing back in some places . But job losses, business closures and lost spending are also causing structural damage to the economy that will take years to repair. Those lost jobs and businesses do matter to the stock market, because they impact profitability at many publicly held companies, and solvency at a few of them. But the power of the Fed outweighs all of that , or at least investors think it does. \u201cUnprecedented support from central banks has helped prevent the vast economic shock caused by the virus from morphing into a financial crisis,\u201d Capital Economics explained to clients on June 4. \u201cWe think that many risky assets could keep outperforming.\u201d So a buoyant stock market makes no sense in relation to the devastation occurring in the real world. But it makes perfect sense given the Fed and other central banks are pushing stocks up, to rebuild confidence in one slice of the economy. Whether you\u2019re incredulous at the stock market\u2019s performance, or cheering it on, you\u2019re right.

According to S&P Global Ratings research, [1] the disruption to the global supply chain will be another critical factor that will weigh on the creditworthiness of some sectors. This disruption will be evidenced by reductions in worldwide import and export volumes, alongside diminishing financial performance of firms and the market\u2019s negative sentiment\u00a0towards some private and public companies. To understand the implications of COVID-19 on supply chains, we have used shipping data and supply chain intelligence from Panjiva, part of S&P Global. We have also used our Probability of Default Market Signals (PDMS) model, which incorporates stock price and asset volatility to calculate a one-year probability of default (PD). This will capture the more immediate market shocks from COVID-19, and enable us to assess the industries and companies that have experienced material changes to their default risk. In addition, our fundamentals-based CreditModel\u2122 is used to gauge if the mid- to long-term credit risk of these companies has changed significantly. Industry Trends As reported by Panjiva research, [2] U.S. imports have slowed in key areas across the Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and Materials sectors. This research looked at these downturns across several product areas and found that Furnishings had the greatest reduction in the first quarter of 2020, followed by Apparel, Iron & Steel, Machinery/Electronics (Industrial and Consumer Equipment), and Chemicals. By generating median PDMS scores at the industry level globally, as shown in Figure 1 below, we have a view of how recent market conditions have impacted the default risk for some industries identified by Panjiva as having the greatest reduction in seaborne U.S. imports. [3] The subset of industries within Consumer Discretionary are exhibiting the greatest increase in default risk/ deterioration in credit quality, and the highest overall\u00a0 PDs a key driver being investors\u2019 concerns that non-essential spending will be severely curtailed. Not surprising, auto manufacturers consistently demonstrated PDs that were higher than the other industries, with a PD at the beginning of April 2020 that was more than 20%. This is partially due to a reduced supply of parts, production disruptions, slumping sales, and falling market optimism as a result of COVID-19.\u00a0 Consumer Electronics (a sub-industry that excludes personal computing) also saw a steep rise in risk, increasing more than seven fold from 2.138% to 14.125% between January 1, 2020 and March 23, 2020, while Home Furnishings had the second highest overall PD throughout April 2020. Chemicals saw the lowest PDMS levels given the strong demand for a subset of critical chemical products, such as pharmaceutical active ingredients, disinfectant gels, personal health, and household products in the current pandemic. Figure 1: PDMS evolution in industries with highest import reduction Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. We can identify these trends since PDMS is an early warning indicator gauged through market estimations of company performance and influenced by falling demand/disruption in the supply chain.\u00a0 Intuitively we can understand this, as reduced imports can be a result of falling demand. Additionally, the restricted supply of parts, materials, and other products will limit an importer\u2019s ability to maintain its output levels. These scenarios could lead to increased default risk. That is not to say that an industry that exhibits higher default risk is necessarily experiencing supply chain related issues as well, as we know that there are many factors that can affect the riskiness of companies within an industry. It is also worth mentioning that PDMS will react to market changes more quickly than import shipping volumes, which, in many cases, will be consigned months in advance. Company Analysis Taking the Consumer Electronics industry as one that has exhibited elevated default risk, we focus on two companies within that industry (Garmin Ltd. And SONOS,Inc.), using Panjiva data to get a more granular view on their supply chain risk, and PDMS to understand the default risk associated with COVID-19. As seen below in Figure 2, Sonos experienced a 45% year-over-year (y-o-y) fall in its associated import volume, from 107 TEU\u2019s [4] to 58 TEU\u2019s in February 2020. This was partially due to reduced demand and the U.S.-China trade tariffs, with approximately 84% of its seaborne imports traditionally coming from China. This y-o-y fall was reduced to 18% in March 2020 but rose again to 50% in April 2020 despite remaining relatively stable from the previous month. With COVID-19 affecting global supply lines, however, the monthly trend could well worsen and y-o-y fall continue. The PDMS for the firm was more risky than its median Consumer Electronics benchmark (in red) from March 2020 onwards. On March 16, 2020 the PDMS was more than 150% higher than the benchmark at 25.9% and 9.9%, respectively, the company\u2019s worst level in this recent period. Imports associated with Garmin Ltd. (Garmin) saw a large y-o-y fall in import volume, declining by 55%, 49% and 75% in February, March and April respectively. However, in absolute terms the fall in import volume over the 6 months from November 2019 to April 2020 was much larger for Sonos than for Garmin. [5] The PDMS for Garmin also remained consistently better than the median Consumer Electronics PD for the past 10 years, and from January 1, 2019 to March, 1 2020 remained below 1%. Despite showing some escalation since March, the company\u2019s PD was still outperforming the peer benchmark by more than 300% on March 23, 2020 [6] and continued to be better than the benchmark throughout April. Sonos would then appear to be more vulnerable from a credit risk standpoint and has seen more impact to its seaborne supply chain.

S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Supply Chain Analysis Understanding where a company\u2019s critical supplies are coming from and the creditworthiness of those suppliers can be essential to assessing the health of that company. Depending on how integral a supplier is to the company, a sudden reduction in supplies can transmit operational and financial stress, especially if the company cannot find an alternative supplier before current inventory is fully depleted. Using Panjiva data, we see that Sonos has more than 100 companies in its supply chain. In Figure 3 below, we show a simple snapshot of some of the firm\u2019s largest suppliers. Figure 3: Sonos\u2019 key suppliers and buyers S&P Global Market Intelligence, Panjiva as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. In Figure 4, we look at the export volume associated with one of Sonos\u2019s biggest suppliers, Wistron Corporation, a Taiwan-based provider of technology hardware with significant production capacity in China. It is clear that seaborne export volume peaked in December 2019 at 172 TEU\u2019s, but has been falling since January 2020, ending at 35 TEU\u2019s in March 2020 and seeming to continue the downward trend in April [7] . The U.S.-China trade war dramatically increased the cost of its exports, with the firm being further impacted by COVID-19 supply chain disruptions from the lockdown. Wistron now says it could move more than half of its production capacity outside of China. [8] Figure 4: Seaborne export volume \u2013 Wistron Corporation S&P Global Market Intelligence, Panjiva as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Figure 5 shows that the early warning signals revealed a sharp worsening of the PDMS from the beginning of March to March 23, 2020. However, from late March onwards there were some improvements as Wistron reported positive earnings results, implemented a share buyback scheme, and increased i's dividends. Despite this, the PDMS was still marginally worse than the industry median benchmark on May 1, 2020, due to the COVID-19 market pressures reducing demand and supply capacity, coupled with the negative market outlook. Figure 5: PDMS performance for Wistron Corporation S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Using CreditModel to assess the mid- to long-term credit strength of Wistron, and perhaps its ability to withstand COVID-19 related business pressures, gives a more positive impression of the long-term creditworthiness of the business. Although this has not yet been factored into its first quarter 2020 financials, Figure 6 shows that in fiscal quarter (FQ) 2019, the second, third, and fourth quarters were consistently displaying a bbb- credit score, which is a notch improvement from the first FQ 2019 at bb+. In addition, the company was outperforming the CreditModel median industry benchmark. We also know from Panjiva data that Wistron is a manufacturing partner for a number of very large companies, including Apple, Lenovo, and Microsoft. This should re-enforce the value of the firm and, perhaps, limit some concerns. However, from a supply chain perspective, their potentially large project to relocate significant production capacity and the trajectory of export volumes will be observed with keen interest. Figure 6: Long-term creditworthiness of Wistron Corporation using CreditModel S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For Illustrative purposes only. Scenario Analysis The overall credit strength of a company plays a crucial role in its resilience to market shocks, such as those presented by COVID-19. Even prior to a company releasing its quarterly financials, we can simulate what the possible impact might be to their creditworthiness. To illustrate this using CreditModel, [9] we ran a stressed scenario of a one-year decline of 50% in revenues and cash flow for both an Investment Grade and Speculative Grade entity.\u00a0 In Figure 7, we assume the company has a credit score of bbb-. After making these revenue and cashflow adjustments, the new score represented by the orange bar remains at the same level (bbb-). This impact is entity specific but, providing that the company continues to make a profit and there is not too much degradation in the other model drivers, it will see a moderate PD of 0.22% Figure 7: Reduction of revenue and cash flow in a company with a CreditModel score of bbb- S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For Illustrative purposes only. In the example below we make the same adjustment to a company with a credit score of bb-\u00a0 this company which was already experiencing a slight increase in its PD had a deterioration by one notch to b+ (or in PD terms from 1.06% to 2.16%) represented by the orange bar. If this company were impacted by COVID-19 in this way, then it would become much more difficult for it to manage its debt obligations. This supports the view that Investment Grade companies are expected to be more resilient than Speculative companies during an economic downturn. Figure 8: Reduction of revenue and cash flow in a company with a CreditModel score of bb- S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For Illustrative purposes only. Summary COVID-19 and the resulting government mandated lockdowns have severely disrupted supply chains and increased the default risk across many industries. Amongst the subset of industries exhibiting high supply chain pressure, Automobile Manufacturers showed a particularly high vulnerability. This was also seen to a lesser extent in other parts of the Consumer Discretionary sector, such as Consumer Electronics.

Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters Most European governments are making decisions on how far and quickly to exclude Huawei from 5G networks. Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor Published on Mon 13 Jul 2020 14.52 BST Robert O\u2019Brien, the US national security adviser, will meet his counterparts from France, Italy, the UK and Germany in Paris this week to urge European nations to debar the Chinese technology company Huawei from Europe\u2019s 5G networks. The meetings, over three days, underline how most European governments are facing similar choices to the UK, which will announce on Tuesday its decision on the company, on how far and quickly to exclude Huawei, and with what consequences in terms of potential Chinese reprisals. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, last month claimed there had been a transatlantic awakening to the threat posed by China. \u201cHuawei\u2019s deals with telecommunications operators around the world are evaporating, because countries are only allowing trusted vendors in their 5G networks\u201d, he said. France has said it will not ban Huawei equipment outright from the country\u2019s 5G network but is encouraging operators not to use it and granting only temporary authorisations of up to eight years to those companies that already do \u2013 SFR and Bouygues Telecom. \u201cWhat I can say is that there won\u2019t be a total ban,\u201d Guillaume Poupard, the head of the French cybersecurity agency ANSSI, said last week. \u201cBut for operators that are not currently using Huawei, we are them not to go for it.\u201d Poupard said the decision was \u201cnot Huawei-bashing, or anti-Chinese racism. All we\u2019re saying is that the risk is not the same with European suppliers as with non-Europeans.\u201d The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has said Paris is aiming to keep the Chinese manufacturer out of the country\u2019s core mobile network, which processes sensitive information such as customers\u2019 personal data. The state-controlled network Orange has already chosen Huawei\u2019s European rivals Nokia and Ericsson. In Germany the government is still divided over Huawei, with some members wanting to exclude it altogether for 5G. Parliament is now in recess, so no decision on what IT security rules Huawei would have to follow in Germany is likely until after the break. In February, Angela Merkel resisted pressure for her party, the CDU, to adopt a policy of removing Huawei from the new network, but the Greens and some in her own party, such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, are saying Germany has to realise the security risk. In Spain the national intelligence service certified the software as safe and compliant with the relative legislation last month. Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s existing 4G technology in Spain depends entirely on Huawei equipment so Telef\u00f3nica will continue to have Huawei technology in what is known as its 5G core \u2013 where the most sensitive information is stored \u2013 for now and in its so-called periphery, which consists of masts, antennas and passive equipment. In central and eastern Europe, the US has had some success at pushing for a tough line in countries strongly reliant on Nato military protection. Romania , Poland , the Czech Republic , Latvia and Estonia have all signed joint statements with Washington on 5G security, pledging that the countries will not allow access to their markets to companies subject to foreign state interference. Last year, Poland arrested a Huawei employee in Warsaw on spying charges, and called for the EU and Nato to develop a joint stance on Huawei. In Hungary , where the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has built friendly relations with China, the government said last November that it had not seen any evidence that Huawei equipment would pose a security threat, and has said it will include the company in its 5G rollout. Tele2, a major telecommunication company in Sweden , is building its 5G network with Huawei equipment. \u201cWe have used Huawei\u2019s equipment since 4G and there have been no security problems,\u201d said Anders Ygeman, the minister for digital development. But TDC, the largest operator in Denmark , earlier this year chose Sweden\u2019s Ericsson to build its 5G network after the Danish energy minister, Lars Christian Lilleholt, underlined 5G security concerns without specifically mentioning Huawei. Two big companies, Vodafone and Eir, are using Huawei technology as they build the 5G network in Ireland . The Trump administration has lobbied Ireland as many US tech companies have operations there and so, in theory, are vulnerable. The Irish government is trying not to say anything publicly but seems content to let Vodafone and Eir plough ahead with Huawei. The European commission has issued guidance \u2013 it has no direct powers \u2013 suggesting EU member states avoid \u201chigh-risk\u201d suppliers and called on governments to take a common approach.

The Italian-American maker of Fiats, Alfa Romeos, Jeeps and Rams said on Friday it slashed advertising costs and saw net prices rise in its key North American market, where it focused on retail sales over lower-margin fleet business. It also cut capital expenditure across the group, and expects to reduce the total for the full year by 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to 8-8.5 billion euros. FCA <FCHA.MI> posted an adjusted loss before interest and tax of 928 million euros for April-June, versus a forecast 1.87 billion euro loss in an analyst poll compiled by Reuters. Earlier in the week, Ford Motor <F.N> reported a second-quarter operating loss of $1.9 billion. General Motors <GM.N> had an operating loss of $1.2 billion. In North America, FCA <FCAU.N> made adjusted earnings before interest and tax of 39 million euros. CEO Mike Manley said production in North America was back to pre-pandemic levels, apart from plants in Warren, Michigan and Toluca, Mexico, which are being retooled for new products. \"We expect a much, much better second half,\" he told investors on a conference call. Milan-listed FCA shares were up 1.5% at 1310 GMT, having been little changed before the results. Manley said the group planned to launch a series of new Jeep models next year, including a new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, and a redesigned Grand Cherokee. Asked about electric pickup trucks coming from its competitors, Manley said FCA was \"very committed\" to electrifying its vehicles, adding: \"Pickup trucks is a key franchise for us. We're not going to sit on the sidelines.\" FCA, which is set to tie-up with Peugeot maker PSA <PEUP.PA> to create Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker, said an ongoing probe by European Commission competition authorities was not expected to delay the merger timetable. Despite the pandemic, PSA earlier this week delivered a profit in the first half of the year. FCA said its industrial free cash flow was minus 4.9 billion euros in the second quarter, with a slightly lower cash burn versus January-March. It finished the quarter with liquidity of 17.5 billion euros. That does not include 4.5 billion euros still available on its loan facility. Ford had liquidity of $40 billion, and GM $31 billion.

But thanks to our unique offer combining seamlessly creative, media, data and technology, to our unmatched backbone of shared services and our strong balance sheet, we have been able to reduce its impact. Our reported net revenue was up 9.7% in H1 with the contribution of Epsilon. Our organic growth in H1 came at -8.0% with Q2 at -13.0%, significantly better than the 23% decline in Global advertising expenditures predicted by Zenith and the 30% mentioned by WFA for Q2. US organic growth was only down by -3.3% in H1, with Q2 at -6.8%, when ad spend is expected to decline by 18%. Our creative and media activities were still positive at the end of May. Europe posted an organic growth of -23.5% in Q2, as the lockdowns impacted most of the second quarter. In Asia, the performance was at -5.7% in Q2, with China clearly improving from Q1 but remaining negative and volatile.Thanks to our ability to adapt fast, our country-model and our strong culture in managing costs, the Groupe demonstrated financial resilience in the first half, with an operating margin rate at 13.0%, despite the sudden drop in net revenue since March.At the same time, we continued to record significant wins in new business across the world, such as Sephora in North America, McDonald\u2019s in China, or Fran\u00e7aise des Jeux in France, demonstrating our ability to continue to win large pitches with our unique model.There is no doubt that we will all have to live with the virus and its economic and social consequences for a while, but Publicis is well armed to weather this crisis.First, we have the products and services that our clients need. Over the last few weeks, we have seen an increased demand for all the capabilities that drove our strategy in the last few years: first-party data, breakthrough creativity, digital-first media and technology. The crisis has clearly accelerated the relevance of our go-to-market. We are uniquely positioned to help our clients take back control over their customer relationship, deliver personalized experiences at scale and reduce their cost while increasing their sales.Second, in a world where our structure needs to be flatter, agile and remote, we are now truly operating as a platform. Our shared service organization has proven its efficiency and we have finalized the implementation of our country model. This enabled us to react faster and immediately answer all our client needs in a seamless way.

Exchange rate variations over the period have a positive impact of 32 million euros. Acquisitions (net of disposals) have a contribution of 743 million euros on net revenue, most of it being related to the acquisition of Epsilon.Organic growth is -8.0% in H1 2020. The Groupe has been impacted by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic from March, with a further decline in organic growth in Q2 following the containment measures that were implemented by governments in different geographies. With its transformation almost completed, the Groupe entered well the year 2020 thanks to its strong tailwind in the US and its continued new business momentum.

Excluding the impact of French activities that were shut down in Q2, like our outdoor media operations and the Drugstore, the organic growth in Europe is -12.9%. The performance varied per country, as it reflects different activity mix and local economic situations. It was also impacted in Q2 by the different containment measures that were decided by governments in the main countries of the region. In H1, organic decline was -14.0% in the UK and -17.1%2 in France. In Germany, organic growth was down -5.3%, also suffering from the lockdown but benefitting from 2019 new business wins in the country.Net revenue in North America is up by +30.1% in H1, including the positive impact of the Epsilon acquisition. On an organic basis, the region posted a decline in net revenue of -3.6% in H1. The performance was resilient, notably in the US (-3.3%), where the Groupe benefitted from a strong start to the year for all its activities.Asia Pacific net revenue was down by -2.3% on a reported basis and down by -3.9% on an organic basis. China reported an organic growth of -10.2%, Australia was down by -5.4% on an organic basis, while India and Singapore grew respectively by +3.6% and +1.5% on an organic basis.Net revenue in Latin America was down by -27.8% on a reported basis, with a significant negative impact from currencies in the region, especially in Brazil. On an organic basis, the decline was -15.7%. This is mostly due to an organic decline of -22.8% in Brazil and of -14.4% in Mexico.Net revenue in the Middle East and Africa region was down by -11.2% on a reported basis, and -11.8% on an organic basis.NET REVENUE IN Q2 2020Publicis Groupe's net revenue in Q2 2020 was 2,293 million euros compared to 2,234 million euros in Q2 2019, up by 2.6%. Exchange rate variations had a 1 million euros negative impact. The acquisitions (net of disposals) contributed 350 million euros to net revenue in Q2 2020, mainly reflecting the contribution of Epsilon.Organic growth was -13.0% in Q2 2020. Excluding the impact of French activities that were shut down during Q2, like outdoor media activities and the Drugstore, organic growth for the Groupe was -11.0%. Most of Groupe\u2019s activities were negatively impacted in Q2, except the Health division which recorded a double-digit growth. Europe was particularly affected as containment measures lasted over the vast majority of the quarter.

The impact of the cost reduction plan announced in April was 286 million euros in H1, on a comparable basis and excluding Epsilon acquisition costs. This translates into a margin rate of 19.3% of net revenue (compared to 20.3% in H1 2019).  * Personnel costs totaled 3,224 million euros at June 30, 2020, up by 12.0% from 2,879 million euros in H1 2019. This evolution reflects the integration of Epsilon during H1, as well as the continued investment in the Groupe\u2019s transformation. This was partly offset by the impact of the first measures of the cost reduction plan. As a percentage of net revenue, the personnel expenses represented 67.5% in H1 2020, compared to 66.1% in H1 2019. Fixed personnel costs were 2,862 million euros represented 59.9% of net revenue versus 57.7% in H1 2019. On a comparable basis, fixed personnel costs declined by 61 million euros year-on-year, thanks to the actions taken by the Groupe, as hiring freeze, pause in internal promotions, shorter work week or voluntary salary cuts. Moreover, the Groupe decided to limit the use of freelancers. As a result, the cost of freelancers declined by 43 million euros in H1 2020 on a comparable basis, representing 141 million euros. Restructuring costs reached 69 million euros (61 million euros in H1 2019), reflecting additional charges related to the cost reduction plan.   \u00a0  * Other operating expenses (excluding depreciation & amortization) amounted to 1,131 million euros, compared to 1,104 million euros in H1 2019. This represents 23.7% of net revenue compared to 25.4% in H1 2019, implying that the cost reduction measures more than offset the negative impact of Epsilon cost structure on this ratio. The Groupe was able to make significant savings on other operating expenses in H1 2020, thanks to the actions taken as part of the cost reduction plan, and thanks to some expenses that drastically reduced during the lockdowns. This was notably the case with travel restrictions, which mechanically reduced the travel, recruitment and seminar related expenses.Depreciation and amortization charge was 301 million euros in H1 2020, up by 10.3% compared to H1 2019. The increase is largely due to the consolidation of Epsilon over the period.The operating margin amounted to 622 million euros, up by 1.6% compared to H1 2019. This represents a margin rate of 13.0%, down by 110 basis points from 14.1% in H1 201. When compared to the H1 2019 margin excluding Epsilon acquisition costs, the margin declined by 200 basis points. This decrease is due to the decline in organic growth related to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, partially offset by a 6.4% reduction in the cost base.Operating margin rates by major geographic areas reflected the various challenges faced by the different regions in H1 2020, in the context of the global pandemic. It was 1.8% in Europe, 16.4% in North America, 22.5% in Asia-Pacific, 5.7% in Latin America and 3.0% in the Africa / Middle East region.Amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions totaled 142 million euro in H1 2020, up from 27 million euro in H1 2019. This increase is mainly due to the amortization from July 1st 2019 of new intangibles arising from Epsilon acquisition and the amortization of tradenames arising from acquisition. Starting from July 1st, 2019 tradenames are amortized, following the implementation of our country-model organization. Impairment losses amounted to 231 million euros, and are exclusively related to the real estate consolidation plan \"All in One\", which leads to a reduction in the number of sites, while allowing better collaboration between the teams. In H1 2019, impairment losses were 113 million euros (of which 90 million euros related to real estate plan \u201cAll in One\u201d). In addition, net non-current income is positive at 5 million euros H1 2020, compared to an income of 17 million euros in H1 2019.Operating income totaled 254 million euro in H1 2020, after 489 million euro in H1 2019.The financial result, comprising the cost of net financial debt and other financial charges and income, is an expense of 92 million euros in H1 2020 compared to an expense of 1 million euros last year. The net expense on net financial debt was 48 million euros in H1 2020, including a 51 million euros interest charge related to Epsilon\u2019s acquisition debt. Last year, it was a net income of 15 million euros. Other financial income and expenses were a charge of 44 million euros in H1 2020, notably composed by 40 million euros interest on lease liabilities. Other financial income and expenses were a charge of 16 million euros in H1 2019, including 30 million euros of interest on lease obligations and 19 million in income from the fair value remeasurement of Mutual Funds.The revaluation of earn-out payments amounted to a profit of 2 million euros at end-June, compared to a charge of 1 million in H1 2019.The tax charge is 39 million euros, corresponding to a forecast effective tax rate of 25.0% in 2020, compared to 136 million euros in H1 2019, corresponding to a forecast effective tax rate of 25.8% in 2019.The share in the profit of associates is a loss of 2 million euros, compared to a loss of 5 million euros in H1 2019. Minority interests were an income of 13 million euros in Groupe results in H1 2020 compared to a loss of 1 million in the previous year.Overall, net income attributable to the Groupe was 136 million euros at June 30, 2020, compared to 345\u00a0million euro at June 30, 2019.Free Cash FlowEUR million H1 2020 H1 2019  EBITDA  923  885   Financial interest paid (net)  (81)  33   Repayment of lease liabilities and related interests  (234)  (214)   Tax paid  (74)  (190)   Other  34  42   Cash Flow from operations before change in WCR 568 556  Investments in fixed assets (net)  (73)  (65)   Free cash-flow before changes in WCR 495 491    The Groupe\u2019s free cash flow, before change in working capital requirements, is slightly up by 0.8% compared to H1 2019, at 495 million euros. Financial interest paid mostly include interests on the acquisition debt of Epsilon. Tax paid amounted to 74 million euros, down compared to 190 million euros in H1 2019, related to agreed postponements for tax payment in some countries in H1 2020. The increase in net investments in fixed assets is mostly related to Epsilon. The Groupe is very selective regarding its investment policy, favouring IT spending especially to support work from home initiatives that have been implemented in Q2.Net debtNet financial debt amounted to 3,221 million euros as of June 30, 2020 compared to 2,713 million euros as of December 31, 2019. The Groupe's average net debt in H1 2020 amounted to 3,684 million euros compared to 550 million euros in H1 2019. The increase in average net debt reflects the financing linked to the acquisition of Epsilon, for 4.5 billion dollars.

Following the UK launch earlier in the year, Marcel rolled out in the US in April, with 90% of the employees who have adopted the platform in the US in less than a month.\u00a0 Marcel was launched in other markets around the world in the weeks that followed, with 60,000 Publicis Groupe employees now connected through the platform. All of Publicis\u2019 talents around the world now have a unique\u00a0way\u00a0to share their expertise, learn, collaborate, and contribute to client assignments. Among its features, Marcel is the exclusive destination for available opportunities within the company also offering \u201cgigs\u201d- short-term projects, where employees who want to do more can raise their hand to contribute, matching skills and bandwidth with need, and delivering a true distributed, borderless workforce. Marcel is\u00a0becoming\u00a0central\u00a0in\u00a0our ability to allocate resource for clients and new business within the Groupe, train our talent for this new world, communicate and sometimes celebrate. Marcel allowed Publicis to virtually host its Cannes-Do Awards last month, ensuring the company continued to spotlight and celebrate creativity even in a year when most awards shows cancelled. Through Marcel, the company garnered 1,400 award submissions from all parts of the company and world, from which 10 client campaigns and five non-profit campaigns were selected winners via 15,000 employee votes through the platform and a panel of judges, and the ceremony livestreamed exclusively on Marcel.    In addition, Marcel enabled the company to come together in new ways. Pausing for Action, hosted on Marcel June 17, brought together 18,000 employees for a day of listening, learning and ideating how to move forward the Publicis Groupe diversity and inclusion mandate. Through the platform, the company virtually presented six hours of content spanning speakers, three learning tracks, plus \u201copen briefs\u201d in which 7,300 employees engaged to shape the future of the Groupe\u2019s efforts. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIONGuided by the input of the company\u2019s US workforce during Pausing for Action, Publicis Groupe committed to seven focused actions for the U.S., with ongoing measurement and accountability to drive diversity and inclusion. These actions include: publishing and monitoring workforce data; cultivating the careers of Black talent; designing a recruitment, interview and onboard experience that champions Black talent; building strong ally-ship culture with mandatory \u201cdisrupting everyday bias training;\u201d \u20ac45M investment over three years on Diversity, Inclusion and Social Justice; launch Open Apprenticeship on Marcel to serve minority youth who typically do not have access to the industry; and create the Diversity Progress Council, comprised of internal members, key clients and external representation, to measure progress and evaluate actions on an ongoing basis, with the first meeting taking place in September. As part of commitment to publishing U.S. workforce data, the Groupe released its first diversity numbers on July 1, importantly doing so in a way that provided the transparency that the U.S. market requires to drive and measure change. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS   There were no significant transaction on the period.OUTLOOKThe full impact of the current crisis on the economy remains largely unknown. This creates uncertainties which make it difficult to provide any specific guidance for the second half of 2020.When it comes to net revenue, Q2 could be the low point, but it is premature to say whether the second half will be better or worse than the first half, as some sectors but also some countries will recover faster than others, and clients will react differently.The operating margin rate will be higher in H2 than in H1, taking into account that several factors will have a negative impact: as countries reopen, some of the operating expenses will resume, and the Groupe will continue to invest in its model.Heading into the second half, the Groupe is committed to limit the impact of client cuts, accelerate its new offering and continue to adapt its cost base to the evolution of revenue. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *  DisclaimerCertain information contained in this document, other than historical information, may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.\u00a0 These forward-looking statements and forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.

Revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts were both revised downwards, with the analysts seeing grey clouds on the horizon. Shares are up 5.3% to \u20ac127 in the past week. It will be interesting to see if this downgrade motivates investors to start selling their holdings. Following the latest downgrade, the three analysts covering Barco provided consensus estimates of \u20ac996m revenue in 2020, which would reflect an uncomfortable 8.0% decline on its sales over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are anticipated to descend 18% to \u20ac6.20 in the same period. Before this latest update, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of \u20ac1.2b and earnings per share (EPS) of \u20ac9.31 in 2020. Indeed, we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Barco\u2019s prospects, administering a substantial drop in revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot. Check out our latest analysis for Barco ENXTBR:BAR Past and Future Earnings March 29th 2020 It\u2019ll come as no surprise then, to learn that the analysts have cut their price target 20% to \u20ac210. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company\u2019s valuation. The most optimistic Barco analyst has a price target of \u20ac265 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at \u20ac175. There are definitely some different views on the stock, but the range of estimates is not wide enough as to imply that the situation is unforecastable, in our view. Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse, with the forecast 8.0% revenue decline a notable change from historical growth of 1.6% over the last five years. Compare this with our data, which suggests that other companies in the same industry are, in aggregate, expected to see their revenue grow 5.3% next year. It\u2019s pretty clear that Barco\u2019s revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry. The Bottom Line The biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates, suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for Barco. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates, and industry data suggests that Barco\u2019s revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. After such a stark change in sentiment from analysts, we\u2019d understand if readers now felt a bit wary of Barco. Even so, the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for the value creation of shareholders. We have estimates \u2013 from multiple Barco analysts \u2013 going out to 2024, and you can see them free on our platform here. Of course, seeing company management invest large sums of money in a stock can be just as useful as knowing whether analysts are downgrading their estimates.

Silver, despite record retail investment, has sunk to its lowest price in 11 years due to lower industrial demand. In this part, we use S&P Global Market Intelligence data and insight to look at how the metal price environment for the precious metals and uranium has evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the gold price dropped mid-March along with those for most other commodities and markets, it has since come back strongly on the back of higher financial investment demand. Meanwhile, silver, despite record retail investment, has sunk to its lowest price in 11 years due to lower industrial demand. Looking at the platinum group metals, or PGM, lockdowns in South Africa and plummeting global auto sales have severely shocked prices. This disruption has kept an uneasy balance, however, and has not yet fundamentally changed the price trajectories of upward for palladium and rhodium, and downward for platinum. Gold: After the fall, time to shine Despite being the archetypal safe-haven asset, gold, like everything else, eventually took a hit to the downside on the realization that COVID-19 would become a global pandemic. Through mid-February, gold continued in its slow-burn bull market, driven by two main factors. The first was safe-haven buying resulting from global uncertainty, tied to the shutdown in China up to that point, and also the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and eurozone weakness. The second was low to negative yields on high-quality government bonds. When funds have to pay for lending to governments, the attractiveness of gold increases, especially when the cost to hold is at a historical low. While gold performed well in the lead-up to the stock market crash \u2014 reaching a seven-year high of US$1,684 per ounce March 6 \u2014 when it became clear March 12 that the U.S. economy would take a serious hit, gold began to fall at the same time as equities. Gold performed in a fashion similar to the 2008 financial crisis, in that funds with positions in gold in the futures markets were forced to sell their gold to meet margin calls, raise cash and buy U.S. treasuries. We look in more depth at this phenomenon in an earlier\u00a0article . This selling on the futures market overwhelmed significant positive sentiment on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, major retail buying in the West and large inflows into gold exchange-traded funds, or ETF. From the week beginning March 23, however, the gold price rebounded at the same time as a bear market rally in U.S. stocks. Since then, gold is back up above the highs before the stock market crash, with the Comex price reaching US$1,752.6/oz on April 7 on an intraday basis. Looking at managed money positions, the net long on gold has been fairly flat since August 2019, changing little until the mid-March stock market crash. The net longs dropping to their lowest level since July 2019 was more related to a drop in the volume traded. In fact, the gross short position of 1.56 million ounces in the week starting March 29 was the lowest in over 10 years. So, clearly, the positive market sentiment for gold remains. Meanwhile, gold continues to flow into ETFs, with 132.5 tonnes moving in between Feb. 28 and March 27, according to the\u00a0World Gold Council. On March 27, total holdings stood at 3,165.5 tonnes, the highest amount ever. On the retail side, sellers are\u00a0reporting\u00a0huge demand for bars and coins, with many lines out of stock or with long wait times. This shortfall has been exacerbated by the temporary closure of the main gold refineries\u00a0Valcambi SA,\u00a0Argor-Heraeus SA\u00a0and\u00a0PAMP SA\u00a0in Switzerland, due to the lockdown in that country. They have\u00a0signaled\u00a0in recent days, however, that they will partially re-open, helping miners to bring their gold to the market and investors to buy it. Despite the mid-March fall in the gold price, in tandem with the stock market crash, the yellow metal has recovered and the market appears convinced that it is on an upward trajectory. There are some negative signals for the market, however, namely reduced jewelry buying in India and China due to pandemic lockdowns. In addition, we\u00a0forecast\u00a0a mine production shortfall stemming from shutdowns in major mining countries. Silver: Double hit with not much light at the end of the tunnel The silver price, which has largely traded sideways since 2015, has plummeted to multiyear lows. Starting March 12, when U.S. stock markets had their greatest single-day fall since the 1987 crash, silver fell from US$17.02/oz to US$12.01/oz on March 19, a fall of 29%. That is the lowest price for silver since April 17, 2009. Although the price has recovered slightly in recent weeks, at around US$14/oz it remains near the lows of 2019 and has wiped out the brief rally enjoyed in the second half of 2019 and the first two months of 2020. Being both a financial and an industrial metal, silver has been dealt a double blow. With manufacturing purchasing manager indexes down across the board, silver industrial demand, which largely comes from brazing alloys and electronic and photovoltaic fabrication, is forecast to decline. On the financial side, traders have been closing out their positions on the futures markets to meet margin calls and to raise cash to buy government bonds \u2014 much like the situation with gold. Having said that, demand for physical silver in the Western world had skyrocketed when stock markets crashed and silver prices went down, with bullion and coin merchants reporting unprecedented demand. Indeed, at the time of writing, none of the main U.K. online dealers had any silver bars in stock. This has been matched in the ETF markets, with reports of huge inflows. While silver was dragged down during the stock market crash, the weakness of industrial demand has acted as a lead weight for silver, leaving it unable to ride gold's coattails upward on the back of safe-haven buying. According to\u00a0The Silver Institute, in 2018 the ratio of industrial demand over investment demand was 2.5. In the short term, the outlook for the precious metal is bleak given the weak economic conditions. If this crisis continues into the third quarter, however, we expect that reductions in mine supply due to a national shutdown in Peru, the second-largest producer of silver, will have an impact on the net balance. PGM: Finding a volatile equilibrium Even before the COVID-19 crisis spread across the global economy in March, the PGM markets were experiencing a volatile period. The ultimate repercussions of the \"dieselgate\" emissions cheating scandal were being felt, in that car manufacturers were being forced to comply with emissions standards across a broad range of conditions, not just a single lab test. Those emissions are controlled by catalytic converters, which use PGM to reduce emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. In order to meet these standards, higher loadings of PGM are needed, so that despite a\u00a0global car sales recession\u00a0in 2019, demand for PGM has risen. The different uses of platinum and palladium in autocatalysts had led to their large price divergence in recent years. Palladium is used more in gasoline vehicles, while platinum has a higher weighting in diesel vehicles. In the short-to-medium term, consumers are moving back to gasoline vehicles in markets like Europe, driving up demand and, with limited supply, the price. Palladium reached an all-time high of US$2,781/oz on February 27, continuing a string of all-time highs since January 2018. The fresh highs were caused by\u00a0Anglo American Platinum Ltd.'s, or Amplats, announcement that it was declaring force majeure at its Waterval smelter due to a\u00a0dust explosion. This caused analysts to forecast an even wider palladium market deficit in 2020. The market moved sideways for the next week, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped as a result of the Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war. The March 12 stock market crash caused the London Bullion Market Association price to drop by US$339/oz in a single day, the largest single-day decline ever, due to global recession fears. For the next week, prices found a floor at US$1,600/oz, before rebounding in a classic U-shaped recovery. Platinum fell from US$879/oz on March 11 to US$593/oz on March 19, the lowest price since December 2002, a 17-year low. Since then, the price has managed to stay above US$700/oz, which is less of a recovery than palladium has enjoyed. Market participants are concerned that sales of diesel vehicles will be hit harder than sales of gasoline vehicles, since the former are more popular in Europe, where the current restrictions show no sign of being lifted. Indeed, car sales figures were\u00a0down year over year\u00a0in March, by 85% in Italy, 72% in France, 69% in Spain and 44% in the U.K. On the supply side, following the stock market crash South Africa, the world's top miner of all PGM, declared a 21-day lockdown due to COVID-19, which led to Amplats,\u00a0Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.\u00a0and\u00a0Sibanye-Stillwater Ltd.\u00a0all\u00a0declaring force majeure\u00a0March 30, which will further constrict supply. However, this comes as just at the time when vehicle demand is down the most in decades, and therefore demand for PGM is down. It appears, therefore, that the market is trying to find a new equilibrium, with slightly lower prices. Much like palladium, rhodium had been increasing in price at an exceptional rate since the start of the year. This was driven by tightness in the thinly traded market, caused by restricted supply and increased demand as a result of more stringent enforcement of vehicle emissions standards. Just days before the Schengen travel ban was put in place by the U.S. government, rhodium reached an all-time high of US$13,800/oz, up a staggering 128% since the start of the year. Since then, in a pattern similar to many others, the price quickly dropped, falling by 60% in eight business days to US$5,500/oz on March 24. With mine supply drying up, the only certainty is that market volatility will remain. U3O8: The best performer since the crash The uranium price is normally less susceptible to global headwinds than other commodities, since most output is taken up by three-to-five-year agreements with fixed prices. The uranium price, therefore, had a muted reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak compared with other commodities, falling only 3.8% from the start of the year to March 22. However,\u00a0Cameco Corp.\u00a0announced\u00a0March 23 that it was placing the\u00a0Cigar Lake\u00a0mine in Canada, the world's largest uranium mine, producing 13% of global supply in 2019, on care and maintenance. This was done to protect workers from COVID-19, which was difficult without closure due to the operation's remote location in northern Saskatchewan, where miners fly in to work. The closure caused a\u00a0rally\u00a0in the price, to above US$27 per pound for the first time in one year, as market participants worried about possible supply shortages. On April 7,\u00a0JSC National Atomic Co. Kazatomprom\u00a0announced\u00a0that was reducing its 2020 guidance by 4,000 tonnes of elemental uranium, which makes up 18% of its previous guidance. The Kazakh company, the world's largest uranium producer, previously stated in a March\u00a0press release\u00a0that COVID-19 could cause significant disruption to its remote mining sites in southern Kazakhstan, due to the close quarters in which its employees work. The press release caused the price to leap still further to US$29/tonne on April 8. While global demand for power has declined due to widespread industrial shutdowns, baseload electricity demand remains. Production of uranium is highly concentrated among a small number of companies and countries; if mines continue to close temporarily, we expect upward pressure on prices to remain.

Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters Investors are increasingly concerned about sustainability. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters Animals farmed is supported by About this content Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro Published on Tue 28 Jul 2020 07.30 BST The investment arm of northern Europe\u2019s largest financial services group has dropped JBS, the world\u2019s biggest meat processer , from its portfolio. The Brazilian company is now excluded from assets sold by Nordea Asset Management, which controls a \u20ac230bn (\u00a3210bn) fund, according to Eric Pedersen, its head of responsible investments. The decision was taken about a month ago, over the meat giant\u2019s links to farms involved in Amazon deforestation, its response to the Covid-19 outbreak, past corruption scandals , and frustrations over engagement with the company on such issues. \u201cThe exclusion of JBS is quite dramatic for us because it is from all of our funds, not just the ones labelled ESG,\u201d Pedersen said. ESG stands for the \u201c environmental, social and governmental \u201d standards used to evaluate a company\u2019s sustainability and societal impact for investors. A third of Nordea Asset Management\u2019s investments are classified as ESG, Pedersen said. Nordea was one of 29 international financial institutions managing $3.7tn (\u00a32.9tn) worth of funds that warned the Brazilian government last month over rising deforestation. Last year, Nordea suspended the purchase of Brazilian government bonds after the Amazon fires crisis. Over the past year alone, five expos\u00e9s by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the Brazilian agency R\u00e9porter Brasil, Greenpeace and Amnesty International, have linked JBS to cattle supplied by Amazon farms involved in deforestation. Although the company has made advances in controlling its \u201cdirect suppliers\u201d \u2013 the farms from which its slaughterhouses source cattle \u2013 it is unable to control its \u201cindirect suppliers\u201d. These are farms breeding or rearing cattle that sell on to farms that in turn supply JBS slaughterhouses. In some cases, the \u201cclean farms\u201d have links to \u201cdirty farms\u201d \u2013 or are even run by the same people, as in the latest case revealed on Monday. JBS and Brazil\u2019s other large-scale meat producers Minerva and Marfrig have been subject to controversy over their Amazon cattle sourcing for more than a decade. In 2009, after a devastating Greenpeace report , JBS, Marfrig, Minerva and other companies committed to stop buying from any direct suppliers involved in deforestation. Within two years, they promised to verify that their indirect suppliers were not involved in deforestation, either \u2013 but that promise has yet to be fulfilled. That same year JBS, Minerva and Marfrig signed similar deals with federal prosecutors . In 2017, JBS was fined $7.7m by government environment agency Ibama for buying over 49,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas in the Amazon state of Par\u00e1 \u2013 some from indirect suppliers. As a result, Greenpeace walked out of the deal, but the agreement with federal prosecutors still stands. In July 2019, an investigation published by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and R\u00e9porter Brasil found that JBS slaughterhouses in the same state had bought cattle from farms owned by AgroSB Agropecu\u00e1ria SA, a powerful ranching company. Those farms had been supplied with cattle from another ranch owned by the same company \u2013 a ranch with a long history of fines and land embargoes for deforestation. AgroSB said the deforestation had occurred before it bought the land in 2008. JBS said it did not buy cattle from land that had been illegally deforested or embargoed against use for ranching and that its own 2018 independent audit showed that more than 99.9% of its purchases met the terms of the Greenpeace deal. It did not say that its independent audit recognised the company was unable to audit its indirect suppliers. And earlier this year a R\u00e9porter Brasil investigation published by the Guardian linked the company to a farmer whose farm, according to satellite images, had seen extensive deforestation in 2015. A sawmill the farmer had owned in another location also had a long list of fines. A court recently dropped charges against him in another case involving the massacre of nine men. Meat companies in Brazil say they are working to improve transparency in their supply chains. Photograph: Joedson Alves/EPA JBS reiterated its previous position that it did not buy cattle from farms involved in deforestation, invasion of indigenous reserves, rural conflicts or land conflicts, and denied the farmer had ever been a supplier. The company said it monitored more than 50,000 potential cattle-supplying farms every day and had blocked more than 8,000 due to non-compliance. It told the Guardian: \u201cFull traceability of our supply chain including workable solutions to monitor indirect supply remains a top priority. New initiatives have been proposed and are being examined with stakeholders on top of the substantial policies that have already been implemented.\u201d On 1 July it introduced a new \u201ctheoretical index\u201d that uses a farm\u2019s productivity to calculate if it is suspected of cattle laundering and now checks supplier farms for Ibama embargoes. It has also said it is working on a \u201cgreen\u201d version of cattle movement records with Brazil\u2019s agriculture ministry that would show the environmental status of supplying farms. The company has said it has been discussing the scheme with the ministry since 2014. Marfrig repeated its previous statements and said it was \u201cfully aware of the challenges related to the livestock production chain\u201d, highlighting its mechanism under which farmers supply information on their suppliers. It said 53% of its Amazon cattle came from indirect suppliers. Minerva said its Amazon cattle purchases were \u201c100% made in monitored farms\u201d but that it was not possible to fully track Amazon cattle movements without full access to government data, which it does not have. In June this year a Greenpeace investigation reported by the Guardian found JBS, Marfrig and Minerva had bought cattle from a farm that sourced cattle from another farm inside a protected reserve in Mato Grosso state co-owned by the same owner \u2013 who had been charged with environmental crimes. According to a 2017 Observer report , JBS had said it had blocked purchases from farms inside the reserve. This month, Amnesty International, with R\u00e9porter Brasil, revealed that cattle illegally grazed in protected areas of the Amazon state of Rond\u00f4nia had entered the JBS supply chain. JBS says the company \u201cis fully committed to achieving a deforestation-free beef supply chain and avoiding irregular suppliers. We acknowledge that indirect supplier traceability remains a system level issue in Brazil and are working with governmental and cross-industry stakeholders to find workable solutions. We urge anyone with evidence of malpractice to report it to the appropriate authorities. We also operate a company whistleblowing hotline for any employee to contact if they see or suspect irregularities.\u201d But Pedersen said scandals such as these, and JBS\u2019s response to them, influenced Nordea\u2019s decision to exclude the company from its portfolio. \u201cWe\u2019ve had several meetings with them in Brazil and regular updates by phone and video and we\u2019ve not been impressed with the level of commitment we could see from their side,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see progress, we have to take that step.\u201d Sustainability is increasingly important not just for ESG investments, Pedersen said, but for standard products, too. \u201cWe are also engaging with Minerva and of course Marfrig,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bar keeps rising.\u201d JBS told the Guardian that it does not comment on dialogue with its shareholders. On 23 July, Marfrig launched its own ambitious plan to monitor all indirect suppliers in the Amazon by 2025 and Brazil\u2019s Cerrado savanna region by 2030, using chips in cattle, satellite monitoring, blockchain and risk maps, as well as schemes to help farmers previously involved in deforestation produce sustainably. \u201cThe details are lacking of when it will start, what is the target per year, what system will be used,\u201d said Daniel Azeredo, the federal prosecutor involved in the 2009 deals with the meat companies, but he stressed: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive plan.\u201d Adriana Charoux, Greenpeace Brazil\u2019s senior forest campaigner, said the company\u2019s deadlines were too long. \u201cMarfrig knew the roots of this problem in 2009,\u201d she said. Minerva said that in July it began testing Visipec , a cloud-based, tracing tool developed by the University of Wisconsin and the US National Wildlife Federation. It said it monitors over 9,000 suppliers in the Amazon, but said \u201ccurrently there are no data and accessible statistics \u2026 to determine the number of indirect suppliers in Brazil.\u201d Topics Deforestation Animals farmed Brazil Meat Meat industry Americas Farming Food (global) news Reuse this content World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Will coronavirus trigger a global recession? | Jeffrey Frankel Read more The cutbacks came as several other European companies warned that the outbreak was hurting their operations or introduced emergency measures to protect staff. Sky said its offices would bar visitors who had been in high-risk countries in order to reduce the threat of contagion for its staff, with all guests required to complete a form at reception desks. The Italian manufacturer MTA, which makes electrical parts for cars, has been forced to close its factory in Codogno after the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy. It said the closure would have a knock-on effect on production at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s plants in the country before spreading to other carmakers across Europe. The closure of the plant in the Lombardy region would immediately force Fiat to shut production lines at four plants as soon as Wednesday, MTA said. Continued closure would mean all the other Fiat plants in Europe and those of Renault, BMW and Peugeot would close from 2 March. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK\u2019s largest carmaker, and the lorry makers Iveco and CNH, would be affected if the shutdown lasted longer. Diageo, the UK-based owner of Guinness and the world\u2019s biggest whisky producer with brands such as Johnnie Walker, said Covid-19 could hit its profits by up to \u00a3200m as restaurants and bars in China stay shut. Q&A How can I protect myself and others from the coronavirus outbreak? Show Hide The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days . If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days , to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. SSP Group, the British operator of restaurants and bars in airports and railway stations, said its sales across the Asia Pacific region would slump by half in February. FTSE 100 tumbles below 7,000 points as Diageo warns of \u00a3200m coronavirus hit - business live Read more Diageo predicted a decline in profits of \u00a3140m-\u00a3200m in the year to the end of June. Sales are expected to be down by up to \u00a3325m. Its estimates excluded the impact of the coronavirus on other markets beyond Greater China and Asia Pacific. Diageo said the majority of consumption of its products in China took place in bars and restaurants, which mostly remain closed. \u201cWe have seen significant disruption since the end of January, which we expect to last at least into March,\u201d it said. \u201cThereafter we expect a gradual improvement, with consumption returning to normal levels towards [June].\u201d The company also highlighted the impact in South Korea, Japan and Thailand, where events have been postponed, conferences and banquets have been cancelled and a drop in tourism has also had an impact on consumption in bars and restaurants. The significant drop in international air travel, especially across Asia Pacific, has also hurt Diageo\u2019s business, including sales in airports. Danone, the maker of products including Volvic and Evian bottled water, and Activia yoghurts, said it would take a \u20ac100m (\u00a384m) sales hit in the first quarter as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. The French-based company was experiencing a \u201csevere demand slowdown\u201d for its Mizone water brand in China, which is Danone\u2019s second biggest market and accounted for 10% of global sales last year. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Danone employs 8,200 staff in China and has eight factories, seven of which support its water business. The company said water production resumed on 17 February except for at its factory in Wuhan, which is at the centre of the outbreak. SSP said in the Asia Pacific region, which generates 8% of group revenues, domestic and international air travel relating to China was down 90%, Hong Kong was down 70% and Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines were down 25% to 30%. Its share price fell almost 4% on Wednesday morning and the company said group revenue would be down by \u00a310m-\u00a312m in February, with operating profits down \u00a34m-\u00a35m.

The in-depth four-month probe was triggered June 10 after the companies reportedly did not resolve the European competition watchdog's concerns regarding their combined small van units, which would capture a third of the segment in Europe. The FT noted that the companies have been reluctant to sell the divisions, which are highly profitable. The European Commission declined to comment, while Fiat Chrysler and PSA did not immediately respond to S&P Global Market Intelligence's requests for comments.

Despite the fact we are still far from beating the COVID-19 pandemic, the automakers are increasing their capital spending on the EV segment.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Fiat Chrysler delivered a loss of $1.24 billion during the second quarter, which marks a drop of 232% compared to last year's result. But its Stellantis chapter is set to change its circumstances. After its merger with Groupe PSA, Peugeot's maker (OTC: PUGOY), it will revamp its Warren Truck plant, just outside Detroit, to build the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Once completed, it will add a new product to its Jeep line - a three-row SUV capable of going where there are no roads. FCA is confident it can meet the challenge posed by Ford's new line of Broncos.But Ford's new offering does not have a three-row vehicle. And after the merger, FCAU is set to become the world's fourth largest automaker.Ford Ford's Bronco reboot was unveiled last month, after supposedly receiving 100,000 reservations for the two new models. Also, there is the redesigned Ford F-150 that has been postponed fourth quarter. Ford's Chief Financial Officer, Tim Stone, announced an expected profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter. However, he also warned that the launches of the redesigned F-150, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E will result in the company being in the red during the fourth quarter.But the bottom line is that Ford is poised to be in a much better position for 2021 as several new products will be available for sale. Moreover, Ford recently delivered an unexpected profit of $1.1. billion for its second quarter. But it was due to a one-time $3.5 billion gain on its investment with self-driving software Argo AI, recorded on its statement of financial position as a \"special item,\" as otherwise Ford would have delivered a loss like in the first quarter. Its better-than-expected results were attributed to an efficient operational execution that involved a safe restart of its plants while reducing costs, while its efforts were complemented by a favorable pricing environment.General Motors General Motors also announced that it will boost the production of full-size pickup trucks by 1,000 units per month at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant by expanding its workforce. According to its Chief Financial Officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, GM is at the end of a sweeping change in its truck portfolio. The down time in the last three years is behind GM as this will be its new bright spot. But the giant also left its first quarter profit begin as it swung to an $800 million loss in the second quarter and burned $7.8 billion in cash.Trucks In The Age Of Renewables Overall, there are many developments that pickup truck owners and fans can rejoice in. Moreover, there are many new products to look forward to such as Worksport's product line of solar powered tonneau covers for pickup trucks. Worksport (OTC: WKSP) and its three new technologically advanced light truck tonneau covers will be launched in the U.S very soon. Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling pickup truck for more than four decades. But considering these developments, that may no longer be the case.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

Unit A, 49 William\nPickering Drive, Albany is one of four industrial\nunit-titled properties on a large site located near the\njunction with Rosedale Road, and zoned Business-Light\nIndustry. It has been home to New Brew Bar for nearly 20\nyears and there is a 9-year lease from September 2014 with\nannual reviews and a 6-year right of renewal in place,\nreturning a net rental of $130,571 plus GST. The current\nowner of the building is transitioning his property\nportfolio to the Bay of Plenty and also looking to relocate\nto the region, so is selling his Auckland-based\nassets. Bayleys agents Eddie Zhong and Millie Liang are\nmarketing the property which is to be sold by auction on\n24th June at Bayleys Auckland Central. Zhong says the\nproperty was built in 2001 and developed into a bar and\nrestaurant with a good quality fitout. New Brew Bar has\noperated from this site since 2002, with its current\nbusiness owners, Julian and Veronica Dapena, taking over in\n2012. Subsequent improvements have been made to the\nproperty, with the main feature being a covered front\ncourtyard area which extends the venue\u2019s footprint with\noutdoor seating areas. \u201cThis is a well-performing\nhospitality operation that has cemented its place in the\nlocal community and has generated good returns,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cNew Brew Bar has grown a loyal customer base and\nworked hard to establish a strong reputation for good food\nand all-round hospitality, and its owners are looking\nforward to continuing this for many years to\ncome. \u201cThroughout the COVID-19 lockdown and subsequent\nalert levels, the business remained in contact with its\nregular customers through social media channels and offered\nonline ordering and collection for meals, along with live\nmusic performances via Facebook. \u201cThe business has shown\nresilience and adaptability and it\u2019s seeing a steady\nreturn of its local clientele as alert level restrictions\nease.\u201d Liang says retail/industrial units in the wider\nAlbany area have proven popular with investors for some\nyears now, and even during lockdown, deals were being\ncompleted. \u201cThere\u2019s a well-documented shortage of\nquality stock on the market and while it is too early to say\nwhat impact the latest global health crisis will have on\ncommercial property prices, we expect solid demand for\nwell-located, well-tenanted properties,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cThe owner\u2019s decision to take the property to\nauction shows a clear commitment to letting the market speak\nand establish value.\u201d The property has 368sqm of floor\narea, a 56sqm courtyard with consented canopy and 24\ndedicated on-site car parks \u2013 a particularly rare asset\nfor such a property. Internally, the space is largely\ntaken up by bar and restaurant seating, and there\u2019s a\ngenerous commercial kitchen, office spaces and storage to\nthe rear along with male and female bathroom amenities and\nstaff facilities. There are polished aggregate floors in\nthe main public areas and large bi-fold doors lead out to\nthe front courtyard area which is partially-enclosed with\nschist walls and features retractable all-weather\nblinds. Zhong says the business operation benefits from a\nlarge commercial and residential catchment area which is\nwell-resourced. \u201cThe residential homes in the broader\narea are generally of high value and supported by quality\nschooling options,\u201d he says. \u201cThese households have\nstrong purchasing power and the North Shore offers them an\nextensive array of services, including a diverse selection\nof hospitality venues. \u201cIt will take more than a global\npandemic for Kiwis to completely change their social ways\nand stop meeting at their favourite local entertainment and\nhospitality spots once it is deemed safe to do so without\nrestriction. \u201cNew Brew Bar has found customers returning\nwith confidence proving that having a beer with mates,\nenjoying a quiz night or a live music gig, and eating out\nwith family and friends is a big part of the New Zealand way\nof\nlife.\u201d \u00a9 Scoop Media Bayleys Real Estate New Zealand Bayleys is New Zealand's largest full-service real estate company.

TROISE Associated Press 29 May 2020 Reblog Share Tweet Share Share Stocks closed out a solid week on Wall Street Friday with a late-afternoon rebound after worries that President Donald Trump would reignite a costly trade war with China faded. The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.5%, recovering from a 1% slide, after Trump outlined several actions in response to a move by China to exert more control over Hong Kong but steered clear of upending a trade pact struck with Beijing earlier this year. The S&P 500 ended the month 4.5% higher, its second monthly gain in a row. The world\u2019s two largest economies agreed to a Phase 1 trade deal in January after more than a year of talks and billions of dollars in tariffs imposed on each other\u2019s imports. Worries that the Trump administration would pull out of the deal with the world\u2019s second-largest economy weighed on the market for much of the day, until the president\u2019s mid-afternoon statement. \u201cMuch ado about nothing,\u201d Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said of the remarks. \u201cThe immediate concern, meaning the cessation of the Phase 1 (trade) accord, did not end up being put on the table, much to traders\u2019 relief.\u201d Technology and health care stocks accounted for much of the market\u2019s gains. That helped offset losses in banks, industrial companies and elsewhere. Bond yields fell and gold prices rose, signs that investors remain cautious. Oil recovered from an early slide. All told, the S&P 500 rose 14.58 points to 3,044.31. The index ended the week with a 3% gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 17.53 points, or 0.1%, to 25,383.11. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, gained 120.88 points, or 1.3%, to 9,489.87. The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks gave up 6.64 points, or 0.5%, to 1,394.04. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic knocked the market into a breathtaking skid in February and March, though the S&P 500 is still down 10% from its all-time high in February. On Thursday, China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress approved a national security law aimed at suppressing secessionist and subversive activity in Hong Kong, overriding any potential opposition by local lawmakers. In his remarks, Trump blasted China, saying Hong Kong is no longer \u201csufficiently autonomous\u201d to warrant the preferred status that the U.S. had been giving the former British colony when it comes to export controls, extradition treaties and travel. \u201cBasically, he\u2019s going to treat Hong Kong the way he treats China,\" Stovall said. Trump also said the U.S. would cut ties with the World Health Organization, saying it had failed to adequately respond to the coronavirus because China has \u201ctotal control\u201d over the global organization. The move by China to get a tighter grip on Hong Kong could undermine the city\u2019s status as a major center for trade and finance. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index finished 0.7% lower Friday. Washington and Beijing have been trading harsh rhetoric recently on everything from Hong Kong to the response to the coronavirus outbreak. That stoked worries that the renewed tensions could lead to another punishing round of escalating tariffs between the two countries, which would only further damage a global economy punished by a severe recession due to the pandemic. The U.S. stock market plunged 34% from late February through late March but has rebounded quickly since then after the Federal Reserve and Congress pledged unprecedented amounts of aid for the economy. Recently, investors have favored stocks that would benefit the most from a reopening economy. Governments around the country and around the world are slowly lifting restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. That has many investors hoping the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon. However, concerns remain that the relaxing of stay-at-home mandates and the reopening of businesses could lead to another surge in infections, potentially extending how long it will take for the economy to recover. \u201cWe\u2019re in an incredibly fragile economy right now, and things are just getting back,\u201d said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \u201cYou need as much momentum as you can that encourages people to go out and spend money. Anything that upsets that fragile sort of enterprise has the opportunity to really set the stock market and the total economy off course.\u201d Story continues The yield on the 10-year Treasury, a benchmark for interest rates on many consumer loans including mortgages, fell to 0.65% from 0.70% late Thursday. Lower yields mean investors are cautious about the prospects for economic growth and healthy amounts of inflation. Oil prices rose.

Simply Wall St July 15, 2020 Broadly speaking, profitable businesses are less risky than unprofitable ones. Having said that, sometimes statutory profit levels are not a good guide to ongoing profitability, because some short term one-off factor has impacted profit levels. Today we\u2019ll focus on whether this year\u2019s statutory profits are a good guide to understanding Brand Architekts Group (LON:BAR). We like the fact that Brand Architekts Group made a profit of UK\u00a3793.0k on its revenue of UK\u00a317.8m, in the last year. Below, you can see that both its revenue and its profit have fallen over the last three years. See our latest analysis for Brand Architekts Group AIM:BAR Earnings and Revenue History July 15th 2020 Not all profits are equal, and we can learn more about the nature of a company\u2019s past profitability by diving deeper into the financial statements. Therefore, we think it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at Brand Architekts Group\u2019s cashflow, as well as examining the impact that unusual items have had on its reported profit. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. A Closer Look At Brand Architekts Group\u2019s Earnings One key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio . The accrual ratio subtracts the FCF from the profit for a given period, and divides the result by the average operating assets of the company over that time. This ratio tells us how much of a company\u2019s profit is not backed by free cashflow. That means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. While it\u2019s not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That\u2019s because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth. Over the twelve months to January 2020, Brand Architekts Group recorded an accrual ratio of 0.49. As a general rule, that bodes poorly for future profitability. To wit, the company did not generate one whit of free cashflow in that time. Over the last year it actually had negative free cash flow of UK\u00a39.9m, in contrast to the aforementioned profit of UK\u00a3793.0k. We saw that FCF was UK\u00a3205k a year ago though, so Brand Architekts Group has at least been able to generate positive FCF in the past. Having said that, there is more to the story. The accrual ratio is reflecting the impact of unusual items on statutory profit, at least in part. How Do Unusual Items Influence Profit? Brand Architekts Group\u2019s profit suffered from unusual items, which reduced profit by UK\u00a3251.0k in the last twelve months. In the case where this was a non-cash charge it would have made it easier to have high cash conversion, so it\u2019s surprising that the accrual ratio tells a different story. It\u2019s never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And, after all, that\u2019s exactly what the accounting terminology implies. If Brand Architekts Group doesn\u2019t see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we\u2019d expect its profit to increase over the coming year. Our Take On Brand Architekts Group\u2019s Profit Performance In conclusion, Brand Architekts Group\u2019s accrual ratio suggests that its statutory earnings are not backed by cash flow, even though unusual items weighed on profit. Having considered these factors, we don\u2019t think Brand Architekts Group\u2019s statutory profits give an overly harsh view of the business.

Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA The former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams is among those to have signed the letter. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA Rupert Neate Wealth correspondent @ RupertNeate Published on Mon 27 Apr 2020 18.19 BST The government has dismissed a proposal from church leaders for companies that avoid paying UK taxes by routing \u201chuge profits\u201d through tax havens to be barred from taxpayer-funded coronavirus bailouts and support packages. Senior members of the clergy including the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams said that while vulnerable people were \u201cpaying the price\u201d of an underfunded and unprepared NHS, \u201csome large corporations continue to avoid responsibility, making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens\u201d. They urged the UK government to follow the lead of Denmark, Poland and France in refusing to provide state support to companies registered in tax havens. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, was challenged in the House of Commons on Monday by the Labour MP Peter Kyle about what the government planned to do about companies that had \u201cso aggressively avoided paying tax in this country\u201d. \u201cMany of those same companies are now relying on the largesse and generosity of taxpayers in order to remain solvent in these difficult times,\u201d said Kyle, who sits on the business, energy and industrial strategy committee. \u201cAs the chancellor starts to plan for the recovery economy, will he take this opportunity to have conversations with those companies to make sure that when we do recover they play a much fuller part in our economy going forward? Let\u2019s aim for not business as normal when we get back from this crisis, let\u2019s aim for business as better.\u201d Sunak said it was important that businesses act responsibly, but he did not set out any plans to bar tax-avoiding firms from state bailouts or the furlough scheme. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is right that during this process people act responsibly, and that is something I have urged all businesses to do.\u201d A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cThe aim of all our schemes is to support individuals and companies in the UK, and that is what they are doing, with millions benefiting from our grants, loans and the furloughing scheme. \u201cHMRC has robust tools to challenge businesses who avoid paying their fair share of tax. That is the right way to challenge avoidance, not by denying support to British workers who pay their taxes and would otherwise lose their jobs.\u201d Dear European colleagues! In Denmark we made a simple rule: If companies use tax havens, they don\u2019t get corona support from the government. Maybe something worth copying in your country? Listen to my Danish colleague @jacobmark_sf here. #covid19 pic.twitter.com/XrGdtDQ3Dc \u2014 Margrete Auken #FBPE (@MargreteAuken) April 22, 2020 A tax-haven-based pub and restaurant chain has taken advantage of the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme to furlough 16,500 staff. Stonegate, which is registered at PO Box 2681, Cricket Square, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands , owns the chains Slug & Lettuce, Yates and Walkabout. A spokesperson for Stonegate Pub Company said: \u201cStonegate is a UK business, located in Luton, which pays its entire tax obligations in the UK including corporation tax, employee tax and VAT. Last year Stonegate paid over \u00a3300m in tax in the UK. As a UK business, fully paying UK tax, we have every right to access government assistance such as the furloughing support for our employees whilst our pubs are unable to trade due to Covid.\u201d The church leaders said in their letter published in the Times : \u201cDuring this crisis many of the most vulnerable people in our society are paying the price for a health and welfare system woefully unprepared for an epidemic. Meanwhile, some large corporations continue to avoid responsibility, making huge profits yet hiding their wealth in tax havens. \u201cMore than 80% of the British public believe that legal tax avoidance is morally wrong. This crisis demonstrates why they are right. Today at least $8tn [\u00a36.4tn] sits offshore, with its wealthy owners hiding from their tax and social responsibilities. Developing countries are deprived of up to $400bn every year by tax dodging.\u201d The letter was organised by the Church Action for Tax Justice campaign group and was signed by the Rev Dr Barbara Glasson, president of the Methodist Conference, the Rev David Mayne, moderator of the Baptist Union Council, and representatives from the United Reformed Church and Quaker movement. We can start reshaping the post crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they they are ending this practice. #SayNotoTaxDodgers https://t.co/jnPgrKKr6k \u2014 John McDonnell MP (@johnmcdonnellMP) April 24, 2020 John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said: \u201cWe can start reshaping the post-crisis economy now by demanding no company using tax havens should receive any government bailout assistance until they demonstrate to HMRC they are ending this practice.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has barred all companies registered in tax havens from applying for support from his country\u2019s \u20ac110bn (\u00a396bn) rescue package. \u201cIf your head office is located in a tax haven, it is obvious that you cannot benefit from public support,\u201d he said. Rune Lund, a Danish MP and Denmark\u2019s parliamentary tax spokesman, said: \u201cWhen we spend billions of taxpayers\u2019 money on saving companies and jobs, they need to go to that purpose and not get sent to a tax haven on the other side of the world.\u201d Sir Richard Branson\u2019s plea for the government to lend his Virgin Atlantic airline \u00a3500m has attracted considerable public and political criticism because he lives in the tax-free British Virgin Islands and has not paid personal UK taxes in 14 years. Branson is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person, with an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune . The letter does not name Virgin Atlantic or Branson, who owns 51% of the airline via his Virgin Group company. Virgin Atlantic is registered in the UK, but Branson\u2019s personal holding company, Virgin Group Holdings Ltd, is registered in the British Virgin Islands where there are no taxes. A spokesman for Branson declined to comment on the letter.

Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images Published on Thu 18 Jun 2020 11.22 BST I n the past few months, the world\u2019s central banks, above all the US Federal Reserve, have rescued the global economy from complete collapse for the second time in a generation. Wading unto the breach and armed with the knowledge of how close capitalism came to a system failure in 2008, they have fired the \u201cbig bazookas\u201d of monetary policy, pumping trillions of dollars into the world\u2019s giant pool of money, effectively creating wealth out of nothing. Since 2 March, the Fed\u2019s total assets have leapt by more than half . Since 2008, its balance sheet has grown to 30% of the size of the US economy. Central bankers seem confident their actions will find public approval. \u201cA firefighter has never been criticised for using too much water,\u201d the governor of the Bank of Canada said . This confidence is misplaced. Both left and right have reason to welcome the Fed\u2019s emergency intervention, but new money flooded into private capital markets will inevitably flow into the deepest pockets. And without strengthening the democratic legitimacy of this policy, and using it for socially transformative ends, the reaction will strengthen those who are antagonistic to the practice of government \u2013 the populist right. The stock market\u2019s worst fears seem to have been allayed by congressional action and the Fed\u2019s promised bond-buying spree In his recent book , the French economist Thomas Piketty observes that central banks have become the only effectively functioning organs of government. He doesn\u2019t mean this as a good thing. \u201cMonetary activism\u201d is financial triage against world economic collapse, but it\u2019s also an avoidance tactic. It works by bracketing democracy and letting the technocrats take over. To make decisions about justice and distribution, discussions about taxation, policy and budgets are needed. As the Fed chairman Jerome Powell put it, the central bank has the power to lend but not to tax and spend. It is up to elected officials to \u201cmake decisions about where we as a society should direct our collective resources\u201d. In the last two months, he has all but begged Congress to be more proactive in shaping the direction and volume of the policy. Progressives have reason to praise central banks for offering evidence that the \u201cmoney printer can go brrr\u201d without any clear limit. Economists see no sign of inflation on the horizon. Some have become concerned about inflation in recent weeks, but others worry about the opposite \u2013 deflation. All the extra liquidity has not managed to translate into meaningful growth. This makes an active role for the state in hiring people in sustainable jobs \u2013 in green energy, construction, arts, healthcare, education \u2013 all the more important. Public spending of the New Deal helped cure the Great Depression in the 1930s, so why not a Green New Deal for this one? Central bankers have emerged as unlikely allies in the fight against climate change. Maybe this latest intervention could finally open them up to the idea of \u201cGreen QE\u201d, (quantitative easing) actively supporting decarbonisation by buying up environmentally friendly bonds. Republicans, for their part, are relieved that the Fed rescued the economy from meltdown, giving Donald Trump at least a chance of campaigning amid a recovery. Though unemployment is stratospheric and hundreds of Americans are still dying of Covid-19, the stock market\u2019s worst fears seem to have been allayed by congressional action and the Fed\u2019s promised bond-buying spree. But neither side should feel secure under the sheltering hand of unelected power like the central bank. The politics of money has a way of quickly becoming about other things. Last month, the German constitutional court concluded in a shock ruling that the European Central Bank may have exceeded its mandate in creating so much cheap credit, threatening the monetary response to the crisis. Within days, Viktor Orb\u00e1n suggested that the Hungarian constitution might trump the decisions of the European Court of Justice in his country\u2019s treatment of refugees. What kind of political creatures could the money-printing of central banks spawn? We have seen hints in the past. A decade ago, the proactive Fed was a target for the Tea Party movement. Republicans directed the backlash to control of the House in 2010 and eventually over Congress. Opposing President Barack Obama, the Republican party acted as a drag on recovery efforts and robust healthcare reform. The US is paying the price for their efforts with a dysfunctional healthcare system in a pandemic in which the victims have been disproportionately African American. There are reasons to think the response to the Fed\u2019s actions from the right might be more extreme this time, not only because the scale of both spending and suffering is greater, but also because the fringe itself has become radicalised. Central banks have no shortage of enemies in waiting. President Trump\u2019s description of the Fed as the \u201c enemy \u201d is designed to rob it of the very democratic legitimacy it cannot live without. Libertarians who reject all forms of \u201cfiat currency\u201d unbacked by precious metals, commonly known as \u201cgold bugs\u201d, have grown in influence over the past years. In the US, the most famous libertarian gold bug is probably Ron Paul, whose demand to \u201cEnd the Fed\u201d ran through his 2008 campaign. His son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have also voiced support for a gold standard. Returning to currency that is matched by finite gold reserves could act as a lever to lock in austerity, blocking the expansion of credit and state spending that would be necessary to redress inequality. In Germany, another gold bug, a former precious metals consultant, Peter Boehringer, sits in the Bundestag . His party, the Alternative for Germany, was founded by economics professors in 2013 over the politics of money \u2013 they rejected the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy and management of the eurozone crisis. Another erstwhile gold bug now waits in the antechamber of the Fed itself. Until its recent postponement, Congress was scheduled to vote on the nomination of Judy Shelton to the Fed. Citing Ludwig von Mises and his student Friedrich Hayek as her guides , Shelton has called repeatedly in the past for the return to the \u201csound money\u201d of a gold standard before converting to Trump\u2019s loose monetary policy . For now, alongside the rumblings of a backlash, the actions of the Fed are receiving broad public approval. Elected officials should take this support as a sign that people do not instinctively reject a role for the government in the working of the market under emergency conditions. Lawmakers have time to build on this insight to work with central banks to design economies where uncertainty and hardship are diminished, even after coronavirus has passed. Central banks can be accessories to more equal and just societies, but they can never be the architects. Money must be made to serve the people, not the other way around.

The company reported an adjusted operating loss of \u20ac928 million, down from a profit of \u20ac1.53 billion but better than the S&P Global Capital IQ mean consensus estimate of a \u20ac1.97 billion loss. Non-GAAP loss per share was 65 euro cents versus a 59 cents profit in the year-ago period. An adjusted net loss of \u20ac1.04 billion contrasted with a \u20ac928 million profit a year prior but beat a mean of four analysts' estimates. Revenue dropped 56% to \u20ac11.71 billion from \u20ac26.74 billion, while industrial free cash flow slipped to \u20ac4.90 billion from \u20ac5.56 billion. Global vehicle shipments plunged 63% during the quarter in which key North American and European markets were under coronavirus lockdowns that halted production and impeded retail sales. The company recorded a \u20ac39 million adjusted operating profit in the North America region where its Dodge, Ram and Jeep SUV and pickups have been gaining market share. The deepest regional loss came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa at \u20ac589 million, where the company's main revenue drivers include Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia and Maserati. \"While the company remains vigilant about the health and safety of employees, our plants are up and running, dealers are selling in showrooms and online, and we have the flexibility and financial strength to push ahead with our plans,\" CEO Mike Manley said in a statement. The group has increased its liquidity through a three-year \u20ac6.3 billion credit facility obtained through Intesa Sanpaolo and backed by the Italian government. The company said it remained unable to offer full-year guidance given the uncertainty amid the ongoing pandemic. It added that the European Commission's investigation into its proposed merger with Peugeot SA is not expected to delay the deal, which it anticipates closing by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Fiat Chrysler's Milan-traded shares were 1.3% higher at \u20ac8.91 by midafternoon.

View more All News Press Releases Benzinga Detroit's Automakers Are Stepping Up Their Truck Game As we enter the second half of 2020, the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) are stepping up their game in the truck and SUV segment. Despite the fact we are still far from beating the COVID-19 pandemic, the automakers are increasing their capital spending on the EV segment.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Fiat Chrysler delivered a loss of $1.24 billion during the second quarter, which marks a drop of 232% compared to last year's result. But its Stellantis chapter is set to change its circumstances. After its merger with Groupe PSA, Peugeot's maker (OTC: PUGOY), it will revamp its Warren Truck plant, just outside Detroit, to build the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Once completed, it will add a new product to its Jeep line - a three-row SUV capable of going where there are no roads. FCA is confident it can meet the challenge posed by Ford's new line of Broncos.But Ford's new offering does not have a three-row vehicle. And after the merger, FCAU is set to become the world's fourth largest automaker.Ford Ford's Bronco reboot was unveiled last month, after supposedly receiving 100,000 reservations for the two new models. Also, there is the redesigned Ford F-150 that has been postponed fourth quarter. Ford's Chief Financial Officer, Tim Stone, announced an expected profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter. However, he also warned that the launches of the redesigned F-150, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E will result in the company being in the red during the fourth quarter.But the bottom line is that Ford is poised to be in a much better position for 2021 as several new products will be available for sale. Moreover, Ford recently delivered an unexpected profit of $1.1. billion for its second quarter. But it was due to a one-time $3.5 billion gain on its investment with self-driving software Argo AI, recorded on its statement of financial position as a \"special item,\" as otherwise Ford would have delivered a loss like in the first quarter. Its better-than-expected results were attributed to an efficient operational execution that involved a safe restart of its plants while reducing costs, while its efforts were complemented by a favorable pricing environment.General Motors General Motors also announced that it will boost the production of full-size pickup trucks by 1,000 units per month at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant by expanding its workforce. According to its Chief Financial Officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, GM is at the end of a sweeping change in its truck portfolio. The down time in the last three years is behind GM as this will be its new bright spot. But the giant also left its first quarter profit begin as it swung to an $800 million loss in the second quarter and burned $7.8 billion in cash.Trucks In The Age Of Renewables Overall, there are many developments that pickup truck owners and fans can rejoice in. Moreover, there are many new products to look forward to such as Worksport's product line of solar powered tonneau covers for pickup trucks. Worksport (OTC: WKSP) and its three new technologically advanced light truck tonneau covers will be launched in the U.S very soon. Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling pickup truck for more than four decades. But considering these developments, that may no longer be the case.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

This\nis built on the back of strong retail performace in June,\nalthough spending overall across the four months of the\nCOVID-19 crisis is down 16 per cent. \u201c73 per cent of\nretailers are now saying they are confident their businesses\nwill survive the next 12 months, up from 39 per cent,\u201c\nRetail NZ Chief Executive Greg Harford said today. \u201cThe\nlast few months have been extraordinarily challenging for\nthe retail sector, and although sales over the last few\nmonths have not recovered completely, it is good news that\nwe have seen a significant uplift in spending during June.\nPartly that is attributable to pent-up demand from the\nlockdown period, but it also reflects the fact that Kiwis\nare not travelling overseas, and are instead undertaking\nprojects at home. \u201cHowever, there are significant\neconomic clouds on the horizon. Many jobs across the economy\nare at risk once the Government Wage Subsidy ends, and a\nnumber of households have taken mortgage holidays or\naccessed other support which will also end in the near\nfuture. These factors will likely squeeze consumer spending\nfurther, as households tighten their belts in the coming\nmonths. \u201cImproved confidence has also seen a\nsignificant improvement in employment prospects in the\nretail sector, with the expected number of layoffs\nsubstantially down. Retail NZ is now forecasting a net loss\nof around 6,000 jobs from the retail sector in the coming\nmonths. \u201cThere are substantial supply chain\nchallenges facing the sector at the present time. 41 per\ncent of retailers report that they are facing difficulties\nsourcing stock, because of reduced production abroad and\nfreight challneges. There are delays getting stock into New\nZealand, and in some cases retailers are looking for\nalternative sources of product. \u201cIt is absolutely\ncritical that the Government remains focused on border\nsecurity to prevent a further recurrence of COVID-19 in New\nZealand, but it also needs to look at ways to stimulate the\neconomy. There is strong support in the retail community for\nincome tax cuts, a reduction in GST, and helicopter payments\nto households to support spending. Struggling retailers are\nalso keen to a further extension to the Wage Subsidy, and\ncash grants to businesses to cover backdated rent relief and\nother operational\ncosts.\u201d \u00a9 Scoop Media Join the Scoop Citizen Community 20 years of independent publishing is a milestone, but your support is essential to keep Scoop thriving.

[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Friday, June 25] Earlier, stocks traded choppily after Texas said it was pausing its reopening process due to a renewed surge in Covid-19 infections in the state. Investors also monitored incoming economic data, with a new report showing stubbornly high levels of new unemployment claims. New unemployment claims came in at 1.48 million for the week ending June 20, marking the fourteenth straight week that claims held above one million. Consensus economists had expected new claims to total 1.32 million. Since mid-March, new jobless claims totaled more than 47 million. \u201cJobless claims are not falling fast enough. Everything we have seen in the last week or two between rising case counts/hospitalizations, stalling economic progress in some important states, government job cuts, means one thing: the Phase 4 of fiscal stimulus must be bigger,\u201d Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, said in an email. \u201cThings should be better in 3-4 weeks, but the news will get worse before it gets better.\u201d The risk-off mood came after some states in the South and West reported more increases in new coronavirus cases. California reported more than 7,100 new cases \u2013 a one-day record by far for the state \u2013 while Florida and Texas also reported record jumps in new cases at more than 5,500 each as of Wednesday\u2019s counts. New York, once the nation\u2019s epicenter of new coronavirus cases, along with New Jersey and Connecticut called for a 14-day quarantine for visitors traveling from many of the states seeing major jumps in new cases. With the pandemic still ongoing, the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday slashed its outlook for 2020 global growth to a record low estimate of -4.9% , down from its April estimate of -3%. US global growth is expected to fall by 8.0% in 2020, down from a previous forecast of -5.9%, before rising by 4.5% in 2021. \u2014 4:03 p.m. ET: Stocks shake off earlier declines after Texas halts reopening, ending up for the day Here were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET: S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) : +33.40 (+1.09%) to 3,083.73 Dow ( ^DJI ) : +299.73 (+1.18%) to 25,745.67 Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) : +107.84 (+1.09%) to 10,017.00 Crude ( CL=F ) : +$1.02 (+2.68%) to $39.03 a barrel Gold ( GC=F ) : -$2.80 (-0.16%) to $1,772.30 per ounce 10-year Treasury ( ^TNX ) : -1 bps to yield 0.6740% \u2014 3:19 p.m. ET: Apple set to close more stores in Florida Apple ( AAPL ) said it would be closing 14 retail locations in Florida starting on Friday due to rising coronavirus infections in the state. The company now has re-closed 32 stores across the country. Earlier this week, Apple said it intended to close seven stores in the Houston, Texas area, as that state grappled with a surge in new infections and hospitalizations. The iPhone-maker also announced re-closures of 11 stores across Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and North Carolina last week. \u2014 11:47 a.m. ET: Texas announces halt of phased reopening process Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday just before noon eastern that Texas will temporarily pause any further reopening of state businesses due to the recent increase in virus infections and hospitalizations. Texas had announced the third phase of its reopening process earlier this month , which allowed most businesses including restaurants, bars and amusement parks to open and expand some capacity. \u201cAs we experience an increase in both positive COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, we are focused on strategies that slow the spread of this virus while also allowing Texans to continue earning a paycheck to support their families,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cThe last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business.\u201d \u2014 11:42 a.m. ET: Stocks fall anew Here were the main moves in markets, as of 11:42 a.m. ET: S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) : -13.86 points (-0.45%) to 3,036.47 Dow ( ^DJI ) : -110.35 points (-0.43%) to 25,335.59 Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) : -18.55 points (-0.19%) to 9,892.26 Crude ( CL=F ) : +$0.39 (+1.03%) to $38.40 a barrel Gold ( GC=F ) : -$7.70 (-0.43%) to $1,767.40 per ounce 10-year Treasury ( ^TNX ) : -1.5 bps to yield 0.669% \u2014 10:40 a.m. ET: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott suspends elective surgeries in major cities across the state amid virus spike Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order suspending elective surgeries in major cities in Texas, as a resurgence of virus cases swept the state. The order applies to elective surgeries at hospitals in Bexar, Dallas, Harris, and Travis counties. \u201cAs Texas faces a rise in COVID-19 cases, we are focused on both slowing the spread of this virus and maintaining sufficient hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cThese four counties have experienced significant increases in people being hospitalized due to COVID-19 and today\u2019s action is a precautionary step to help ensure that the hospitals in these counties continue to have ample supply of available beds to treat COVID-19 patients. Story continues \u2014 10:35 a.m. ET: Stocks turn positive, shaking off earlier losses The three major indices pushed into positive territory Thursday morning after opening lower. The Financial and Energy sectors led gains in the S&P 500, with each rallying more than 1.5%. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and American Express led gains in the Dow. \u2014 9:36 a.m. ET: Stocks open lower Here were the main moves in markets, as of 9:37 a.m. ET: S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) : -6.06 points (-0.2%) to 3,044.27 Dow ( ^DJI ) : -92.37 points (-0.36%) to 25,353.57 Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) : -9.06 points (-0.11%) to 9,896.84 Crude ( CL=F ) : -$0.2 (-0.53%) to $37.81 a barrel Gold ( GC=F ) : -$1.90 (-0.11%) to $1,773.20 per ounce 10-year Treasury ( ^TNX ) : -2 bps to yield 0.664% \u2014 8:56 a.m. ET: New York hospitalizations drop below 1,000 for the first time since March 18 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that the state hit a \u201cnew milestone,\u201d with hospitalizations dropping below the 1,000-mark for the first time since mid-March. The state, once the US epicenter of the outbreak, has been gradually reopening businesses over the past several weeks, with new cases, hospitalizations and deaths trending lower state-wide and in New York City after more than two months\u2019 worth of social distancing restrictions. BREAKING: Today NY reached a new milestone. Total hospitalizations fell to 996 \u2014 dropping below 1K for the first time since March 18th. Together we bent the curve. And we aren\u2019t stopping now. Wear a mask. Keep 6 feet apart. Wash hands. Stay smart. #NewYorkTough \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 25, 2020 \u2014 8:32 a.m. ET: Durable goods orders rise 15.8% in May, topping expectations Orders for durable goods, or products intended to last three years or more, rose by a greater than expected margin in May, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s preliminary monthly report. These orders rose 15.8% in May versus a 10.5% increase expected. The jump marked the biggest increase since July 2014. In April, durable goods orders fell by a downwardly revised 18.1%, which had been the biggest drop since August 2014. Core capital goods orders, which exclude aircraft and military goods and serve as a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 2.3%, or more than double consensus expectations. \u2014 8:30 a.m. ET: New jobless claims totaled 1.48 million last week, vs. 1.32 million expected New weekly unemployment insurance claims totaled 1.48 million for the week ended June 20, the Labor Department said Thursday. This was above estimates for 1.32 million, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The previous week\u2019s new unemployment insurance claims were revised up slightly to 1.54 million, from the 1.508 million previously reported. Continuing unemployment insurance claims fell more than expected for the week ended June 13. These declined to 19.522 million, from the previous week\u2019s 20.289 million. \u2014 7:23 a.m. ET: Stock futures mostly lower ahead of the opening bell Here were the main moves in markets, as of 7:23 a.m. ET: S&P 500 futures ( ES=F ) : 3,039.75, down 9.25 points or 0.3% Dow futures ( YM=F ) : 25,285.00, down 108 points, or 0.43% Nasdaq futures ( NQ=F ): 10,014.75, up 4 points, or 0.04% Crude ( CL=F ) : -$0.44 (-1.16%) to $37.57 a barrel Gold ( GC=F ) : -$2.90 (-0.16%) to $1,772.20 per ounce 10-year Treasury ( ^TNX ) : -1.8 bps to yield 0.666% \u2014 6:05 p.m. ET: Stock futures slightly higher after selloff Here were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:05 p.m. ET: S&P 500 futures ( ES=F ) : 3,051.5, up 2.5 points or 0.07% Dow futures ( YM=F ) : 25,421.00, up 28 points, or 0.11% Nasdaq futures ( NQ=F ): 10,020.75, up 10 points, or 0.1% NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 20: Traders, some in medical masks, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 20, 2020 in New York City.

Simply Wall St July 28, 2020 Broadly speaking, profitable businesses are less risky than unprofitable ones. However, sometimes companies receive a one-off boost (or reduction) to their profit, and it\u2019s not always clear whether statutory profits are a good guide, going forward. Today we\u2019ll focus on whether this year\u2019s statutory profits are a good guide to understanding City Pub Group (LON:CPC). While City Pub Group was able to generate revenue of UK\u00a360.0m in the last twelve months, we think its profit result of UK\u00a31.31m was more important. View our latest analysis for City Pub Group AIM:CPC Earnings and Revenue History July 28th 2020 Importantly, statutory profits are not always the best tool for understanding a company\u2019s true earnings power, so it\u2019s well worth examining profits in a little more detail. In this article we\u2019ll look at how City Pub Group is impacting shareholders by issuing new shares, as well as how unusual items have affected the income line. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. One essential aspect of assessing earnings quality is to look at how much a company is diluting shareholders. In fact, City Pub Group increased the number of shares on issue by 74% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares. That means its earnings are split among a greater number of shares. Per share metrics like EPS help us understand how much actual shareholders are benefitting from the company\u2019s profits, while the net income level gives us a better view of the company\u2019s absolute size. Check out City Pub Group\u2019s historical EPS growth by clicking on this link . A Look At The Impact Of City Pub Group\u2019s Dilution on Its Earnings Per Share (EPS). Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have any visibility into its profits three years back, because we lack the data. And even focusing only on the last twelve months, we see profit is down 33%. Sadly, earnings per share fell further, down a full 36% in that time. So you can see that the dilution has had a fairly significant impact on shareholders. If City Pub Group\u2019s EPS can grow over time then that drastically improves the chances of the share price moving in the same direction. However, if its profit increases while its earnings per share stay flat (or even fall) then shareholders might not see much benefit. For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company\u2019s share price might grow. The Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit On top of the dilution, we should also consider the UK\u00a32.9m impact of unusual items in the last year, which had the effect of suppressing profit. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that\u2019s hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. In the twelve months to December 2019, City Pub Group had a big unusual items expense. All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit look worse than its underlying earnings power. Our Take On City Pub Group\u2019s Profit Performance City Pub Group suffered from unusual items which depressed its profit in its last report; if that is not repeated then profit should be higher, all else being equal. But unfortunately the dilution means that shareholders now own a smaller proportion of the company (assuming they maintained the same number of shares). That will weigh on earnings per share, even if it is not reflected in net income. Based on these factors, it\u2019s hard to tell if City Pub Group\u2019s profits are a reasonable reflection of its underlying profitability. In light of this, if you\u2019d like to do more analysis on the company, it\u2019s vital to be informed of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 6 warning signs for City Pub Group (2 shouldn\u2019t be ignored!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.

The carmakers argue that subsidies would help kickstart demand as lockdown measures ease and factories reopen, preventing tens of thousands of job losses amid a global slump in car orders . Bosses such as BMW\u2019s chief executive, Oliver Zipse, have publicly called for grant support to apply across traditional internal combustion engines as well as battery-powered cars and hybrids. The heads of European carmakers including BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler and Jaguar Land Rover discussed the plans last week with Frans Timmermans, the European commission\u2019s executive vice-president for the green deal. The carmakers pushed for a Europe-wide scheme part-funded from the EU budget. Last month Timmermans backed tying carbon dioxide emission limits to any subsidy package, but the carmakers have called for a coordinated stimulus across EU countries that would apply to all cars that meet the Euro 6d standard, effectively meaning any new car would be eligible. In the UK, the car industry has focused its efforts on allowing car dealerships to reopen , but the Vauxhall owner Peugeot confirmed that early discussions over a stimulus scheme covering both battery and internal combustion cars were under way. Talks are being led by the business department under Alok Sharma. The UK already subsidises the sale of battery electric cars , which are generally more expensive than internal combustion cars. Environmental campaign groups have said giving subsidies to all cars would be a missed opportunity to promote a green recovery and to help carmakers move towards all-electric cars with zero carbon dioxide exhaust emissions . Greenpeace said any subsidies should be targeted at less wealthy people and should be conditional on internal combustion engine production ending by 2028. \u201cOnly purely electric, small and light vehicles should be eligible,\u201d said Lorelei Limousin, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace. \u201cIf the green recovery means something, these should be binding conditions across the EU. Any financial support for the car industry should also be conditional on the sector taking concrete steps to rapidly end its growing impact on climate breakdown and our health.\u201d A rise in SUVs has meant average car emissions have risen even as combustion engines have become much more efficient. In other words, a scrappage scheme meant to push consumers towards newer cars could raise emissions. \u201cWe need to encourage carmakers to take the leap into electric vehicles rather than help them finance getting rid of their SUV and high-emissions vehicle stocks,\u201d said Pascal Canfin, a French MEP for the liberal Renew Europe group who chairs the European parliament\u2019s environment committee. He added that support should not \u201crepeat the same mistake we did after the 2009 financial crisis, when we reinvested in the economy but deprioritised the environmental crisis. We lost a decade. Today, we do not have a decade left to lose.\u201d Any increase in demand for cars with higher carbon dioxide emissions would run contrary to the direction of travel for the European industry. Under regulations that came into effect at the start of 2020, carmakers who fail to meet carbon dioxide reduction targets will be fined. The UK is planning to mirror the regulations . Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Julia Poliscanova, the clean vehicles director at the campaign group Transport & Environment, said subsidies must not endanger the recent progress made on electric vehicle sales because of the rules. Electric car sales across Europe doubled year-on-year in the first three months of 2020, according to industry data.

The rating agency said production shutdowns and weak auto demand as a result of the crisis will likely have a negative impact on the French carmaker's revenue and cash flow in 2020. The agency expects the company's financial position to weaken in 2020 before recovering somewhat in 2021 as a result of its planned merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. However, Ratings affirmed its BBB- ratings on Peugeot and its senior unsecured debt as the company is supported by a large net cash position with excellent liquidity and no substantial refinancing needs in 2020. By the end of fiscal 2019, Peugeot's net cash was \u20ac10.6 billion. The agency said the crisis will not structurally impair the company's sound financial profile. It added that the current crisis will not affect Peugeot's planned merger with Fiat Chrysler in 2021. Ratings said the merger with Fiat Chrysler could be critical for Peugeot to seize recovery opportunities in markets like the U.S. and Brazil.

Ratings said a downgrade is likely if the company's adjusted EBITDA margins were to fall and stay below 6% for a long period from an average of 9% in 2018-2019. The agency said it could revise its outlook on Peugeot back to stable if production patterns returned to normal in the second half of 2020, particularly in Europe, where Peugeot holds 17% of the market.

The new\ncloud-based solution is designed to support organisations\nwith customer contact and engagements, create personalised\ncustomer experiences, and reduce costs. Vodafone\nConnect offers a fully-featured, customisable, and locally\nsupported solution built on AWS\u2019s cloud contact centre\nplatform, Amazon Connect. Using technology such as machine\nlearning and data analytics, Amazon Connect automates\ninteractions and provides agents with access to real-time\ndata to create a personalised service, and reduce resolution\ntimes. Vodafone Connect uses demand-based pricing that\ncan be flexible to suit the needs of businesses, fluctuating\nseasonally depending on peak periods. Comparison research\nfrom Vodafone reveals that businesses could save more than\n50 percent on annual subscription and usage costs by\nreplacing legacy contact centre solutions with Vodafone\nConnect. The solution integrates existing customer\nrelationship management platforms such as email, social\nmedia, and SMS, into a single user interface, combining\nreal-time data on previous interactions to help agents\nprovide a seamless customer experience, and increase\nefficiency. It can also scale to support thousands of call\ncentre agents at a time without the need for manual\nintervention. Lindsay Zwart, Vodafone NZ Enterprise\nDirector, says, \u201cWhile traditional call centre systems can\noffer a technically-sound approach for some companies, the\nmove to remote working as a result of COVID-19 social\nrestrictions has accelerated the need for more New Zealand\nbusinesses to adopt cloud-based, secure technology solutions\nto service their customer contact centres, and help to drive\ndown costs. \u201cBy working with AWS, we are offering\nthe world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud\nplatform service for our customers, with the option to tap\ninto the expertise of Vodafone NZ to help organisations\ncreate cost efficiencies, rapidly scale to meet demand, and\nleverage technology to build unique and personal\nexperiences.\u201d Nick Walton, AWS Managing Director for\nCommercial Sector in New Zealand, says, \u201cTechnology is\npaving the way for innovative new customer experiences and\nhelps organisations leverage data to better understand and\nconnect with their customers. \u201cAs personalisation\nincreasingly becomes an important driver of brand advocacy,\nmore organisations in New Zealand are looking at how they\ncan take advantage of cloud to create memorable customer\nconnections, and increase the efficiency of their contact\ncentres.\u201d Vodafone NZ is offering businesses a free\n30-day demo for up to 10 users*, so organisations still\nadapting to remote working solutions can trial Vodafone\nConnect without any ongoing commitment.

The Dow\u2019s loss dragged it 20% below the record set last month and put the index in a bear market. The broader S&P 500 index, which professional investors watch more closely, is a single percentage point away from falling into its own bear market, which would end the longest bull market in Wall Street history. The decline has been one of the swiftest sell-offs of this magnitude. The fastest the S&P 500 has ever fallen from a record into a bear market was over 55 days in 1987. Vicious swings like Wednesday\u2019s session are becoming routine as investors rush to sell amid uncertainty about how badly the outbreak will hit the economy. The day\u2019s loss of 1,464 points wiped out a 1,167-point gain for the Dow from Tuesday and stands as the index\u2019s second-largest point drop, trailing only Monday\u2019s plunge of 2,013. With Wall Street already on edge about the economic damage coming from the virus, stocks went even lower on Wednesday after global health officials declared the outbreak a pandemic. Investors are calling for coordinated action from governments and central banks around the world to stem the threat to the economy from the virus. Doubts are rising about what can come from the US government, though, even after President Donald Trump promised some aid. Investors know that lower interest rates or government spending programmes alone will not solve the crisis. Only the containment of the virus can do that. But such measures could help support the economy in the meantime, and investors fear things would be much worse without them. The Bank of England became the latest big central bank on Wednesday to make an emergency interest rate cut in hopes of blunting the economic pain caused by the virus, which economists call the global economy\u2019s biggest threat. The stakes are rising as the World Health Organisation cited \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d by governments in corralling the virus when it made its pandemic declaration. \u201cThe government probably should have been thinking about stimulus last month,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, Invesco\u2019s chief global market strategist. \u201cEvery day that passes makes the economic impact of coronavirus that much worse.\u201d Many investors are worried that a divided Congress will have trouble agreeing to any plan, she said. Besides worries about the virus and the government\u2019s ability to get something done for the economy, the market was also weighed down by a continued decline in oil prices, said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist at JP Morgan Private Bank. \u201cI want all retail investors to expect this environment will continue: sharp down days, sharp up days,\u201d he said. \u201cThis feeling of whiplash that people feel probably continues for some period of time.\u201d The speed of the market\u2019s declines and the degree of its swings the last few weeks have been breathtaking. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has had seven days in the last few weeks where it swung by 1,000 points. That has happened just three other times in history.

But over the last three years we\u2019ve seen a quite serious decline. Tragically, the share price declined 64% in that time. Some might say the recent bounce is to be expected after such a bad drop. After all, could be that the fall was overdone. View 2 warning signs we detected for Revolution Bars Group There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. We know that Revolution Bars Group has been profitable in the past. On the other hand, it reported a trailing twelve months loss, suggesting it isn\u2019t reliably profitable. Other metrics may better explain the share price move. We note that, in three years, revenue has actually grown at a 7.7% annual rate, so that doesn\u2019t seem to be a reason to sell shares. It\u2019s probably worth investigating Revolution Bars Group further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity. You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). LSE:RBG Income Statement, January 13th 2020 While the share price may move with revenue, other factors can also play a role. For example, we\u2019ve discovered 2 warning signs for Revolution Bars Group (of which 1 is major) which any shareholder or potential investor should be aware of. What about the Total Shareholder Return (TSR)? We\u2019ve already covered Revolution Bars Group\u2019s share price action, but we should also mention its total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Its history of dividend payouts mean that Revolution Bars Group\u2019s TSR, which was a 61% drop over the last 3 years, was not as bad as the share price return. A Different Perspective The last twelve months weren\u2019t great for Revolution Bars Group shares, which cost holders 34%, while the market was up about 18%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Shareholders have lost 27% per year over the last three years, so the share price drop has become steeper, over the last year; a potential symptom of as yet unsolved challenges. Although Warren Buffett famously said he likes to \u2018buy when there is blood on the streets\u2019, he also focusses on high quality stocks with solid prospects.

Honda, BMW and Toyota joined a rapidly lengthening list of carmakers halting European operations on Wednesday, Jaguar Land Rover , the UK\u2019s largest auto firm, as the only one still operating UK plants. The latest closures mean the coronavirus outbreak has temporarily stopped the production lines at plants that employ about 20,000 workers and make more than 1m of the UK car industry\u2019s annual output of 1.5m vehicles. As the pandemic brought the automotive industry grinding to a virtual halt , the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders\u2019 (SMMT) chief executive, Mike Hawes, warned that the industry \u201cstands on the precipice\u201d. Automotive experts voiced concerns that the UK car industry, already struggling to avert decline, may not regain lost ground once the outbreak is over. \u201cLast year, with the uncertainty over Brexit, the shift away from China [amid falling sales] and diesel, it was the perfect storm. This is perfect storm part two,\u201d said Prof David Bailey of Birmingham Business School. \u201cAs assemblers [manufacturers] shut down, it has a cascade effect on the supply chain and some of those firms will have to start shutting down too. \u201cThe fear is a scarring effect. If capacity is lost because of shutdowns, the longer that they go on, the more there is likely to be a permanent impact on an industry that has already been struggling.\u201d He urged the government to consider a wage subsidy scheme to prevent workers being laid off and losing capacity in the sector permanently. Prof Karel Williams at Manchester Business School said it was likely the UK car industry would emerge from the coronavirus crisis smaller than it otherwise would have been. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from what Volkswagen has been saying that lost sales will not be found again and there will be a massive hit in terms of loss-making in the major carmakers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe markets will recover but the companies will be weakened just when they\u2019re requiring large-scale investments in electrification. That will force them to rethink their portfolios of factories, models and markets.\u201d He said existing weakness in the UK auto sector meant firms may sacrifice their British operations to aid their long-term recovery. \u201cThe review of factories, models and markets is not going to be good for the British car industry,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe last thing the industry needs is a major disruption to both demand and supply. The more marginal the operations, the model and the market, the more likely things are to be cut.\u201d About 20,000 UK car workers have been sent home temporarily across the UK industry, while Mercedes-Benz parent, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot have announced broader suspensions of European output. Jaguar Land Rover kept its UK sites operating but has frozen output at its Slovak factory. The suspensions announced on Wednesday will affect Honda\u2019s Swindon plant, already earmarked for closure in 2022, BMW\u2019s Mini plant at Cowley in Oxfordshire and Toyota\u2019s plant at Burnaston in Derbyshire. The three sites employ more than 11,000 people and produce more than 500,000 cars between them annually. UK manufacturers to regear factories to build ventilators for NHS Read more BMW\u2019s chief executive, Oliver Zipse, said the interruption was expected to last until 19 April, while Honda\u2019s will run until at least 6 April. BMW said profits this year would be significantly lower due to the interruptions at plants that accounted for half of the 2.6m cars it built in 2019. Toyota stopped output at more of its plants in Europe and Asia, including factories in Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Jaguar Land Rover, which has plants at Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Halewood,is responsible for almost all of the UK\u2019s remaining production capacity. The firm said it was following government advice but had not yet decided to stop work at UK factories, although work at Nitra in Slovakia will be suspended. The fresh suspensions come a day after Nissan closed its Sunderland factory , Britain\u2019s biggest car plant \u2013 joining the aerospace giant Airbus in ceasing production.

The company, whose U.S. headquarters is based in Michigan, sold 367,086 vehicles in the second quarter, compared with 597,685 units in the year-ago period. All of Fiat Chrysler's brands posted year-over-year declines, including Jeep, which dropped 27% with 176,716 sales. The Dodge brand took the biggest hit, falling 63% year over year with 43,757 sales.

Fiat Chrysler said the \"economic havoc\" caused by the pandemic in April was partially offset by a stronger-than-expected sales rebound in May and June. \"Retail sales have been rebounding since April as the reopening of the economy, steady gas prices and access to low interest loans spur people to buy,\" Jeff Kommor, head of U.S. sales at Fiat Chrysler, said in a news release. The automaker's fleet volume, meaning vehicles owned or leased by a business or organization, remained low in the second quarter as retail deliveries were prioritized.

The Reading building has been empty for more than ten years, leaving a large gap in Wellington\u2019s entertainment district. Attempts to find out whether the owners intend to reopen the cinemas, or not, have never been answered. News from Reading International Reading International, Inc announced its results for its quarter ended March 31, 2020 and provided a COVID-19 business update. Revenue for the quarter decreased from $61.5M in Q1 2019 to $49.2M in Q1 2020 and EBITDA decreased from $4.3M to ($1.8M) in the quarter. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted both cinema and real estate segment results as theaters initially reduced occupancy and then closed before the end of the quarter. Additionally, revenues were negatively impacted by adverse March 31, 2020 foreign currency exchange rates with the Australian and New Zealand dollars declining against the US dollar over the quarter by 7.7% and 6.8%, respectively. Cinema Segment Declines in Cinema segment revenue were moderately offset by (i) the December 2019 opening of Reading\u2019s new state-of-the-art Reading Cinema with TITAN LUXE at the Burwood Brickworks shopping center in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia and (ii) the December 2019 acquisition of the iconic State Cinema in Tasmania, Australia which features 10 screens, a roof top cinema and bar, a large caf\u00e9, and a bookstore. Reading\u2019s theaters have been closed for most of the current 2nd quarter. Certain geographies where Reading\u2019s cinemas operate have experienced lower levels of COVID-19 spread than others. Reading has now re-opened all of its cinemas in New Zealand that were operating prior to the COVID-19 shutdown and the majority of its Australian cinemas. The company expects the remainder of its Australian cinemas will open in the beginning of July. Initially, popular previously released films are being shown to audiences that are experiencing enhanced safety and sanitization protocols that meet or exceed local mandates. In the US, a sizable portion of Reading\u2019s screens are located in Hawaii, where state and local authorities have to-date mitigated the spread of COVID-19 with strict quarantine measures for visitors to the state. Given that Warner Bros. recently confirmed it still plans to open Christopher Nolan\u2019s Tenet on July 31, 2020, Reading anticipates re-opening its U.S. cinemas in July, assuming state and local governments give clearance and subject to applicable operating conditions. Reading currently has four new cinemas in the development pipeline in Australia with lease agreements and additional cinema upgrade plans for others in all its operating countries. The COVID-19 pandemic will the delay the anticipated launch dates for some of these projects and capital allocation will be based on the status of the pandemic in various markets, how certain cinemas react to the ramp up of re-opening, and the overall evaluation of the company\u2019s liquidity. Real Estate Segment Reading has continued to advance certain real estate projects while staff has been working from home during the pandemic, including leasing up spaces and renewing existing leases at the company\u2019s Australian retail centers. Lease renewal and new lease activity was strong during most of the first quarter until emergence of the pandemic. On a local currency basis, Australian property division revenues and property level cash flow set a new first quarter record. While the pandemic forced the temporary closure of most tenant operations except for essential businesses, due to the Australian government\u2019s proactive approach to mitigating the spread of COVID-19, as of May 31, 2020, almost 90% of Reading\u2019s 78 third-party tenants in its Australian retail centers had re-commenced operations with government enforced restrictions with occupancy across Reading\u2019s retail centers now over 97%. On May 27, 2020, Reading executed a multi-year lease to a single tenant, WWP Inc., for the long vacant entire second floor (approximately 11K rentable sq. ft.) of its Culver City, CA headquarters office building. WWP is responsible for building out its space. In New Zealand, in June 2020, the Auckland Council has granted Reading (in consortium with its adjoining landowners) certain resource consents required for the consortium to construct infrastructure needed to further enhance development value of Reading\u2019s valuable 70.4-acre light & heavy industrial up-zoned property in Manukau near the Auckland Airport. Reading\u2019s 44 Union Square development property with approximately 73,113 square feet of net rentable area overlooks Manhattan\u2019s Union Square with the city\u2019s first dome roof that has won design awards. Construction of the improvements necessary to obtain a core and shell temporary certificate of occupancy were substantially completed prior to New York City\u2019s COVID-19 shut down of non-essential construction and business. Reading anticipates that the site will re-open to construction and leasing efforts later this month, and that the core and shell temporary certificate of occupancy will be in place before the end of the summer. In its completed core and shell state, where the premises can now be delivered immediately upon the execution of leases, Reading believes 44 Union Square will be very attractive to potential tenants seeking to have greater control over the size and design of their spaces in a post COVID-19 environment. Balance Sheet & Liquidity Approximately two weeks prior to the COVID-19 government mandated shutdowns, Reading completed amendment of various financing arrangements that extended the maturity dates and increased the size of certain US lending facilities. The maturity date of Reading\u2019s credit facilities with Bank of America, which supports its U.S. Cinema operation, were extended to March 2023 and Reading increased its Cinema 1, 2, 3 term loan with Valley National Bank to $25.0 million from $20.0 million with a new maturity date of April 2022 and Reading having two 6-month options to extend maturity up to April 2023. Reading\u2019s separate New Zealand and Australian debt facilities don\u2019t mature until December 2023. Reading has the option to extend its 44 Union Square construction financing through December 2021 before having to refinance it or sell a leased property. Prior to quarter end, Reading drew down all the unrestricted borrowing capacity on its various facilities to ensure future liquidity given the pandemic. Reading\u2019s March 31, 2020 quarter end cash and equivalents balance jumped to $54.9 million with total outstanding borrowings increasing to $263 million resulting in net borrowings of $208.1 million. Reading has received the necessary bank covenant waivers for the March 2020 quarter and already negotiated covenant waivers with National Australia Bank for both the second and third quarters of 2020. Due to the on-going governmental closures and scaled reopening schedule created by the pandemic, the uncertainty of meeting covenants for the prospective 12 months mandates still classifying certain debt maturing in more than 12 months as current liabilities. Reading anticipates (but can not assure) continuing to receive covenant waivers from the relevant lenders as needed. On March 10, 2020, Reading\u2019s Board of Directors approved the extension of the Stock Repurchase Program and restored the authorization to $26.0 million to purchase Class A shares, expiring March 10, 2022. During the quarter, prior to the closure of the company\u2019s theaters, Reading repurchased 75,157 RDI shares. Due to the pandemic and its impact on the company\u2019s overall liquidity, for the foreseeable future, Reading says its stock repurchase program will likely take a lower capital allocation priority.

Today\u2019s clearance expands the existing FDA-cleared uses of clonoSEQ, as the FDA previously granted the assay De Novo designation for the detection and monitoring of MRD in bone marrow from multiple myeloma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. \u00a0Access to clonoSEQ for CLL patients nationwide is supported by the already-established Medicare coverage of clonoSEQ in CLL, as well as by the FDA\u2019s clearance of clonoSEQ testing for CLL patients in blood and marrow. Medicare coverage is critically important in CLL, as nearly 80 percent of patients living with CLL in the U.S. are of Medicare age. clonoSEQ\u2019s ability to detect MRD in blood provides CLL patients and health care providers with a more convenient and less intrusive option to monitor disease burden.\u201cFDA clearance of clonoSEQ, which can detect one single cancer cell among a million healthy cells, is an important milestone for the CLL community,\u201d said Dr. Brian Koffman, Chief Medical Officer and EVP of the CLL Society, Inc. \u201cLooking with greater accuracy for persistent cancer cells can show how well treatment is working and may help inform important decisions such as changing or stopping therapy. In my own CLL journey, knowing my clonoSEQ MRD status has impacted the way my expert team of doctors and I manage my disease.\u201dFDA clearance of clonoSEQ in CLL was based on clinical validation data from two important clinical trials:  * In an analysis of data from the CLL14 study (n=337), patients with undetectable MRD in blood by clonoSEQ at three months post-treatment had a nearly seven-fold reduced risk of disease progression compared with patients who did not reach undetectable MRD. For purposes of this analysis, an undetectable MRD was defined at a level of 1 cancer cell among one hundred thousand healthy cells (10-5).  * Additional evaluation of the data showed that at 30 months post-treatment, the probability of disease progression for evaluable patients with undetectable MRD was only 5%, as compared to 36% for patients with detectable disease.  * In a second study by Thompson et al, clonoSEQ MRD results were shown to be significantly predictive of outcomes in both blood and bone marrow samples, regardless of the threshold at which MRD was assessed.\u00a0MRD refers to the remaining number of cancer cells that are present in a patient\u2019s body during and after treatment, which may eventually lead to recurrence of the disease. MRD assessment is performed as a series of tests throughout a patient\u2019s cancer journey to evaluate prognosis, determine response to treatment, monitor disease during remission and predict potential relapse. Controlled trials in CLL as well as other blood cancers have shown that even the smallest amounts of residual disease can predict a patient\u2019s long-term clinical outcomes. As novel therapies make deeper and more durable responses achievable for many blood cancer patients, clinicians are increasingly utilizing MRD results to help guide day-to-day patient management. \u00a0\u201cWe know that traditional CLL treatment response criteria are insufficient, so the ability to measure MRD with a test that is one hundred times more sensitive than standard flow cytometry may change our approach to treating CLL,\u201d said Dr. John Pagel, principal investigator and Chief of Hematologic Malignancies at the Swedish Cancer Institute. \u201cA patient\u2019s MRD status gives us timely information about how a treatment is working, so patients and providers can be in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to managing their disease and treatment decisions.\u201dThe availability of clonoSEQ testing in blood will facilitate ease of testing for CLL patients, but as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, some patients may be unable to or may feel anxious about obtaining a blood draw in a hospital or clinic.\u00a0 To address this, Adaptive has launched a service offering which will enable clonoSEQ patients to safely obtain blood draws in alternate settings. Patients can either access minimal-contact blood collection services at any of the nearly 2,000 LabCorp Patient Service Centers in the U.S., or they can have a blood draw performed by a qualified professional in the comfort of their own homes through Adaptive\u2019s collaboration with Phlebotek Solutions, a nationwide provider of mobile phlebotomy services.\u201cThe FDA clearance of clonoSEQ in CLL represents a significant advancement for patients with CLL,\u201d said Lance Baldo, Chief Medical Officer of Adaptive Biotechnologies. \u201cWe believe this first-time clearance for clonoSEQ in blood will be advantageous for both providers and patients. Given the risks that COVID-19 poses for cancer patients, we are proud to be collaborating with two best-in-class service providers to offer clonoSEQ patients flexible and safe options for blood sample collection outside of a hospital or clinic.\u201dAbout the clonoSEQ\u00a0Assay  Prior to CLL, the clonoSEQ Assay was granted De Novo designation and marketing authorization by the FDA for the detection and monitoring of MRD in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using DNA from bone marrow samples. clonoSEQ is the first clinical diagnostic powered by immunosequencing to receive FDA clearance. clonoSEQ leverages Adaptive\u2019s proprietary immune medicine platform to identify and quantify specific DNA sequences found in malignant cells, allowing clinicians to assess and monitor MRD during and after treatment. The assay provides standardized, accurate and sensitive measurement of MRD that allows physicians to predict patient outcomes, assess response to therapy over time, monitor patients during remission and predict potential relapse. Clinical practice guidelines in hematological malignancies recognize that MRD status is a reliable indicator of clinical outcomes and response to therapy, and clinical outcomes have been shown to be strongly associated with MRD levels measured by the clonoSEQ Assay in patients diagnosed with CLL, MM and ALL.\u00a0clonoSEQ is a single-site assay performed at Adaptive Biotechnologies.\u00a0It is also available as a CLIA-validated laboratory developed test (LDT) service for use in other lymphoid cancers.\u00a0 For important information about the FDA-cleared uses of clonoSEQ, including the full intended use, limitations, and detailed performance characteristics, please visit\u00a0www.clonoSEQ.com/technical-summary.About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)  CLL is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).\u00a0 It is one of the most common types of\u00a0leukemia\u00a0in adults. The disease often occurs during or after middle age, with the average age of diagnosis at 70 years old. There were more than 20,000 new cases of CLL in the U.S. in 2019 and more than 200,000 people in the U.S. are currently living with CLL. CLL is considered incurable but 5-year and 10-year survival rates are high, such that many people will require additional treatment over time due to the return of cancerous cells.About Adaptive Biotechnologies  Adaptive Biotechnologies\u00a0is a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on harnessing the inherent biology of the adaptive immune system to transform the diagnosis and treatment of disease. We believe the adaptive immune system is nature\u2019s most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Our proprietary immune medicine platform reveals and translates the massive genetics of the adaptive immune system with scale, precision and speed to develop products in life sciences research, clinical diagnostics, and drug discovery. We have two commercial products, and a robust clinical pipeline to diagnose, monitor and enable the treatment of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune conditions and infectious diseases. Our goal is to develop and commercialize immune-driven clinical products tailored to each individual patient.

This product leverages data by Snyder et al., made available today that map T cells from over 1,000 patients to specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens that elicit an immune response. These data also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are persisting in recovered patients for over 90 days, adding important information to the ongoing effort to define immunity to COVID-19. These results are powered by ImmuneCODE, a groundbreaking open database developed with partner Microsoft, to share the population-wide T-cell immune response to the COVID-19 virus with the research community. An abstract detailing the methodology behind ImmuneCODE, including the most recent database release, is available and the manuscript is currently undergoing peer review for future publication.\u201cThe critical role of the T-cell response is increasingly becoming a focus of attention. While antibodies have been a mainstay of measuring the immune response to vaccines, for COVID-19, it is becoming clear that the T-cell response is necessary for a complete picture of immunity,\u201d said Harlan Robins, Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder. \u201cAdaptive\u2019s proven immune medicine platform is designed for the quantitative sequencing and mapping of T cells at scale from a simple blood draw and can be incorporated seamlessly into clinical trials.\u201dimmunoSEQ T-MAP COVID provides researchers with a quantitative map of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and SARS-CoV-2 antigens that are driving the immune response to vaccines and other therapies in development for COVID-19. This reproducible, high-throughput, high resolution, molecular data will be made available through Adaptive\u2019s existing cloud-based immunoSEQ Analyzer to assist with analysis and visualization of the immune response.\u201cThe ImmuneCODE data and analyses to date have several real-world applications to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including the support of vaccine trials and therapeutic development,\u201d said Peter Lee, Corporate Vice President, Research & Incubations, Microsoft. \u201cAs we continue to grow this groundbreaking database and measure the persistence of the adaptive immune response over time, these critical findings will advance ongoing and new efforts to help solve this global public health crisis.\u201dData from the Snyder et al. manuscript elucidate the magnitude and dynamics of the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from over 1,000 patients and several thousand controls. First, Adaptive\u2019s immune medicine platform was used to identify the parts of the virus that induce a T-cell response. These data confirm findings from other studies showing that T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is directed against a small number of viral antigens in addition to the spike protein, the current target of most vaccines in development. These targets may inform design or enhancement of next-generation vaccines.Then, the shared \u201cpublic\u201d T-cell receptors that are specific to those immunogenic parts of the virus were identified. These TCRs enable T-cell response to the virus to be measured and tracked over time at the individual and population levels. Most notably, >90% of patients still have these shared SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells for several months post confirmed diagnosis, the maximum time period currently available to assess response. Previously published research on other coronavirus infections have demonstrated persistent T cells for years following initial infection, even when antibodies are undetectable in convalescent patients, highlighting the importance of the T-cell response in understanding immunity to the virus.Based on these results and ongoing research on real-world samples, Adaptive is also completing validation of a clinical T-cell based diagnostic to broadly identify past exposure reliably and reproducibly. The Company is pursuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA for use of this diagnostic test, immunoSEQ Dx\u00ae SARS-CoV-2. \u00a0Snyder et al. can be found at: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20165647v1About the T cell  T cells are the adaptive immune system\u2019s first responders to detect any virus. They quickly multiply and circulate in the blood to attack the virus, often before symptoms appear. Among many other jobs, T cells also recruit B cells to produce antibodies after about a week or two to potentially provide immunity against future infection. T cells contain a treasure trove of information that could provide one consistent and trackable measure of the immune response to COVID-19 from initial exposure through viral clearance.\u00a0T cells can \u201cremember\u201d past infections and kill pathogens if they reappear. Since the decline of antibody signals for SARS-CoV-2 over time has been reported by many researchers, T cells need to be studied to assess how long patients remain resistant to reinfection. Given T cells circulate freely in the blood, they are an easy and thus a desirable target for assessing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and potentially immunity.About ImmuneCODE  ImmuneCODE is an open database that provides a detailed population-level view into the adaptive immune response to the COVID-19 virus. Adaptive Biotechnologies and Microsoft are making these data freely available to any researcher, public health official or organization around the world to accelerate solutions to the global pandemic. The database contains detailed information on the virus-specific T cells as well as the virus-related antigens they recognize. The T-cell responses to these antigens will be tracked across the population to create an immune response signature using thousands of de-identified samples combined from organizations around the globe and ImmuneRACE, the virtual clinical study launched in May to help in the race to find a solution to COVID-19.De-identified blood samples from ImmuneRACE, including patients who were actively infected, recovered or were recently exposed to the virus, are being collected by LabCorp, through its Covance drug development business, using a mobile phlebotomy service. Immune cell receptors from these samples are being sequenced using Illumina platform technology and mapped to virus-specific antigens that are confirmed by Adaptive\u2019s proprietary immune medicine platform to induce an immune response. These study data are being pooled with data from thousands of additional unique de-identified patient samples from many institutions around the world. Using Microsoft Azure\u2019s hyperscale cloud and machine learning capabilities, the accuracy of the immune response will be continuously improved and updated online in real time as more samples are sequenced.* Providence, a large health system with 51 hospitals, including the one near Seattle that treated the first U.S. COVID-19 patient, is an initial clinical collaborator. A sampling of some of our other participating institutions include Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), BloodWorks Northwest, Hospital 12 de Octubre, i+12/CNIO (Madrid, Spain), Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS (Meldola, FC \u2013 Italy) / AUSL-Romagna and Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), and Universit\u00e0 di Bologna (Italy) and the NIH in partnership with ASST Spedali Civil di Brescia, Italy and the University of Milano Bicocca-Fondazione MBBM Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Itlay.

The factory is seen as vulnerable and its owner, PSA, has already stopped investing in it.\nPhotograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Peugeot could demand compensation from the British government to keep its Vauxhall factory in Ellesmere Port open in the event of a bad Brexit deal, its chief executive has said. Carlos Tavares, the head of Peugeot\u2019s owner, PSA, said the carmaker\u2019s European workers should not be forced to bear the costs of \u201ccustoms barriers\u201d between the UK and the EU when the transition period finishes at the end of the year. Carmakers have voiced concerns about the future trading relationship between the UK and EU, with repeated warnings that tariffs and customs checks could threaten the survival of large parts of the industry. The Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire, which employs about 1,000 people, is seen as particularly vulnerable because a decision on building a new Vauxhall Astra model is overdue. PSA, which is merging with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , has already stopped investment in the factory. In a call with journalists on Tuesday, Tavares said: \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t find a business case \u2026 we would have to ask the UK government to compensate for that, because it is not ethically acceptable that we ask the continental European workers to pay for the customs barriers to enter the UK market. \u201cThere is a point in time that the UK government needs also to respect its own people by creating conditions for the business in the UK to fly.\u201d Tavares\u2019s comments came as carmakers arranged phone calls and online launch events to replace the Geneva motor show , which was cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak that has already rocked the global car industry. BMW executives swapped handshakes for fist bumps as they unveiled their new i4 electric car concept, a version of which is due to go on sale next year. The presentation was streamed from its Munich headquarters a day after the company quarantined 150 research and development employees after a colleague caught the virus. On a call with journalists, Ola K\u00e4llenius, the chairman of the Mercedes-Benz owner, Daimler, said the company had been gradually increasing production at its Beijing plant since 10 February. The outbreak had highlighted the need to track supply chains back to source, he added. \u201cThis is really day-by-day management,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is too early to tell what the full impact will be.\u201d Tavares said coronavirus had been a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for carmakers that they must take control of battery supply chains that are heavily dependent on China. Peugeot had been forced to step in to help a South Korean battery producer to increase production at a factory in Poland, with supply chains creaking. Shutdowns of battery materials plants in China in particular could make it more difficult for carmakers to hit EU emissions targets this year and next , according to Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based independent automotive analyst. Under the rules, which came into force at the start of the year, carmakers must reduce average carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold in the EU below an average of 95g per kilometre, or face steep fines. China is the world\u2019s key centre for battery manufacture. Of 442 companies involved in the automotive battery supply chain, 207 are based in China, according to the data supplier MarkLines. Honda said on Tuesday it was temporarily cutting production at its factory in Saitama, Japan, because of difficulties sourcing parts. The British supercar maker McLaren said it was flying in parts to bypass problems in its supply chain. As well as supplies, the outbreak has already hit carmakers\u2019 revenues.

An S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis found that overall nonseasonally adjusted U.S. vehicle sales for the period totaled 2.95 million units, down from the 2019 figure of 4.42 million units. Passenger car sales declined 46.9% during the period to about 685,168 units from 1.29 million vehicles in the second quarter of 2019. Sales of trucks, minivans and SUVs for the quarter dropped 27.7% to 2.26 million units, compared to 3.13 million in the year-ago period. While major U.S. automakers reported year-over-year declines in sales, they said sales showed signs of recovery in the latter half of the quarter. Detroit-based General Motors Co. sold 492,489 units, down 34% year on year from 746,659 units in the second quarter of 2019. All of the automaker's brands posted year-on-year drops, including Cadillac, which declined 41.4%. GM said demand outpaced supply in the latter half of the second quarter and retail sales recovered significantly in May and June after a decline in April. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV posted a 38.6% decline in total sales for the period to 367,086 vehicles. All of the company's brands were down compared with a year earlier, with the biggest drop from Dodge at 63%. Fiat Chrysler said a stronger-than-expected sales rebound in May and June partially offset the \"economic havoc\" the pandemic caused. \"Retail sales have been rebounding since April as the reopening of the economy, steady gas prices and access to low-interest loans spur people to buy,\" Jeff Kommor, head of U.S. sales at Fiat Chrysler, said in a statement. U.S. sales at Ford Motor Co. decreased 33.3% from the year-ago period to 433,869 units in the quarter. All Ford and Lincoln models posted year-over-year decreases in sales except for the Ford Ranger pickup truck and the Ford Explorer SUV. During the second quarter, Ford's F-Series outsold all the other vehicle brands sold in the U.S., even as its sales fell 22.7% year on year to 180,825 units. GM's Chevrolet Silverado took second place with 122,432, down 14.1% from a year earlier.

Judicial authorities in Germany are conducting an in-depth probe of suspected manipulation on 200,000 vehicles made by the two companies as well as their subsidiaries, according to a news release from Eurojust, an EU agency that supports cross-border judicial and investigative co-operation. The probe focuses on cars that can pass emissions testing but then shut down their emissions control systems in real driving conditions. The Eurojust news release did not mention which vehicles were affected but police in Frankfurt called for purchasers to contact them as witnesses, citing Fiat, Jeep, Alfa Romeo and Iveco models made from 2014 to 2019 with Euro 5 and Euro 6 diesel standards. Relevant engines were the 1.3, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.3 litre multijet engines, and 1.6, 2.0, 2.3 and 3.0 litre engines. Fiat Chrysler and Iveco\u2019s parent company CNH Industrial confirmed a number of their offices were searched and that they are providing \u201cfull co-operation\u201d in the investigation.

Sales in March were 203,000 down on the same month a year earlier, according to data released by the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). March is traditionally one of the strongest months of the year for new car sales because of the release of new number plates. However, this was the weakest March since the late 90s, when the twice-yearly number plate change was introduced. Britain\u2019s car industry was already struggling before the pandemic \u2013 hit by a combination of falling sales, a shift away from diesel vehicles and Brexit uncertainty. Quick guide UK government support for workers and businesses during the coronavirus crisis Show Hide Income subsidies Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to \u00a32,500 a month. There are similar wage subsidies for employees. Loan guarantees for business Government to back \u00a3330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to \u00a35m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.

Cash grants Britain\u2019s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of \u00a310,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of \u00a325,000. Benefits Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by \u00a31,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits. Sick pay Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above \u00a394.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills. Other Local authorities to get a \u00a3500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief. Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The figures are a stark indication of what happens when economies grind to a halt, said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT. \u201cHow long the market remains stalled is uncertain but it will reopen and the products will be there. In the meantime, we will continue to work with government to do all we can to ensure the thousands of people employed in this sector are ready for work,\u201d he said. Dramatic falls in new car sales have been reported in other European countries that introduced lockdowns earlier than Britain, including Italy, where sales fell 85% in March, France, down 72%, and Spain, which was 69% lower. The second quarter will be the most difficult for the auto industry, according to the investment bank JP Morgan, which has downgraded its global car production forecast for Europe , the Americas and China from 9% to a 19% fall compared with 2019. Forecasts suggest the continued closure of car plants across Europe and North America will cost the auto industry more than $100bn (\u00a382bn) in lost revenues if the shutdown lasts until the end of April. All major European carmakers have suspended production because of disruption caused by the spread of the coronavirus and if this continues as expected until the end of April, this will account for \u20ac66bn (\u00a358bn) in lost sales in Europe, or 2.6m cars. In North America it would lead to lost sales of about $52bn (\u00a342bn), or 2m cars. The calculations have been made by Ian Henry, the owner of the consultancy AutoAnalysis, who produces forecasts for the SMMT, along with the automotive team at consultancy GlobalData. Assembly lines ground to a halt in March as the lockdown across Europe disrupted global supply chains, and analysts predicted large falls in demand in all key markets. Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk All volume manufacturers from BMW to Toyota and Nissan to Jaguar Land Rover sent their workers home after the worsening outbreak on the continent led companies to examine the health implications for their workers . The story was repeated across North America as the Detroit carmakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, shut down their plants . Auto firms initially closed their sites for a number of weeks, saying they would keep the situation under review, but the shutdown is anticipated to last longer than first expected. Henry predicts that each additional week of plant closures in Europe will cost the industry an extra \u20ac8bn (\u00a37bn) in lost production value and similarly $7.5bn (\u00a36bn) in North America. International supply chains complicate the question of when car plants can reopen, Henry said, while it is also difficult to predict when consumers will starting buying cars again. \u201cWhat will be the state of consumer demand after this?\u201d Henry said. \u201cWill the man in the street want to buy a new car? A huge proportion of cars go to companies and fleet managers won\u2019t be looking to buy cars for executives.\u201d Topics Automotive industry BMW Toyota Nissan Jaguar Land Rover Europe Coronavirus outbreak news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story New car sales rise in UK after coronavirus lockdown decline Year-on-year July increase comes as dealerships and factories started to reopen Published: 5 Aug 2020 New car sales rise in UK after coronavirus lockdown decline Northern Ireland to be left out of new UK car emission restrictions Quirk in regulations means vehicles sold there will count as EU sales for strict CO2 limit Published: 2 Aug 2020 Northern Ireland to be left out of new UK car emission restrictions UK car dealership Pendragon to cut 1,800 jobs Owner of dealers such as Evans Halshaw to shed head office and showroom staff as Covid-19 deepens industry crisis Published: 30 Jul 2020 UK car dealership Pendragon to cut 1,800 jobs UK gives Ford \u00a3500m in loan guarantees to support exports Move comes before Bridgend plant is shut by US carmaker but \u2018safeguards jobs\u2019 elsewhere Published: 22 Jul 2020 UK gives Ford \u00a3500m in loan guarantees to support exports Aston Martin raises \u00a3207m in equity and debt after sales slump Published: 26 Jun 2020 Aston Martin raises \u00a3207m in equity and debt after sales slump UK car industry 'could lose one in six jobs due to Covid-19 crisis' Published: 23 Jun 2020 UK car industry 'could lose one in six jobs due to Covid-19 crisis' Jaguar Land Rover to cut more than 1,000 agency staff in UK Published: 15 Jun 2020 Jaguar Land Rover to cut more than 1,000 agency staff in UK Lookers auditor resigns as car dealership delays results again Published: 8 Jun 2020 Lookers auditor resigns as car dealership delays results again More more on this story Most popular World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

General Motors' Mary Barra and Fiat Chrysler's Mike Manley were told to resolve the matter by U.S. District Judge Paul Borman , who called the claim a \"waste of time and resources\" and a \"nuclear option\" during the global coronavirus crisis. \" These legalities will not only divert and consume the attention of key GM and FCA executives from their day jobs \u2014 issues of vehicle production and sales and safety \u2014 but also prevent them from fully providing their vision and leadership on this country's most pressing social justice and health issues,\" Borman said. GM filed the suit against Fiat Chrysler in November 2019, alleging that the Italian-American automaker corrupted labor talks and United Auto Workers contracts in 2009, 2011 and 2015, resulting in it achieving better terms than its competitors. A federal corruption investigation led to the jailing of several union members and FCA executives. GM said it paid billions in incremental labor expenses as Fiat Chrysler won labor concessions in the deal. Fiat Chrysler in a statement said it acknowledged the judge's concerns and would \"look forward to meeting to discuss them and ideally put this matter behind us.\" \"GM has a very strong RICO case and we look forward to constructive dialogue with FCA consistent with the court's order,\" General Motors spokesman Jim Cain reportedly said.

Engines used by Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep vehicles as well as in CNH Industrial's Iveco trucks have been found to contain potentially illegal engine management software to mask excessive pollution levels, Frankfurt prosecutors said. The Frankfurt prosecutor's office stopped short of naming Alfa Romeo and Fiat's parent company, Fiat Chrysler, since under German law only individuals, not companies, can be prosecuted. The investigation targets nine individuals working at an \"internatioal carmaker\" and seeks to establish their role in putting cars equipped with potentially illegal emissions software on public roads the prosecutor's office said. A spokesman for FCA said that a number of the group's offices in Europe were visited by investigators in the context of a request for assistance by magistrates in Germany, adding that it was cooperating fully with authorities. In a similar emailed statement, CNH Industrial confirmed that a number of its offices in Europe have been visited by investigators after a request by German magistrates and that it was cooperating fully with authorities. FCA and CNH Industrial are both controlled by Exor <EXOR.MI>, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family. Potentially illegal software has been detected in the 1.3 litre Multijet and 1.6 litre Multijet engines used in Alfa Romeo, Jeep and Fiat engines as well as in commercial diesel engines used in Iveco and Fiat commercial vehicles, the prosecutors said. Although these cars passed pollution tests in a laboratory, the cars used software to largely switch off exhaust emissions filtering while driving on the road, they added. The investigation, which is coordinated by EU justice agency EUROJUST, focuses on nine individuals living in Italy and their activities between 2014 to 2019, they said.

Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk On Friday the Japanese carmakers Nissan and Honda further delayed restarting their manufacturing plants near the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China until at least 11 March after the latest government directive to contain the spread. The shutdown in China has disrupted the global supply chain as carmakers struggle to source the tens of thousands of parts needed for each car. This week, Ralf Speth, the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said the company had been forced to fly parts in suitcases from China to the UK as supplies continued to dwindle. Fiat Chrysler has warned it could halt production at one of its four European plants if the supply from China continues to be affected. Toyota and Peugeot-Citroen said their supply chains may be affected but neither expected to close UK plants as a result.

The Italian-American automaker, which posted a smaller-than-expected operating loss for the second quarter, is seeing a significant order book from higher-than-expected vehicle demand and markets recovering more quickly than anticipated, Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley said during the company's earnings call. Order books in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, and Latin America are stronger than before the pandemic, Manley added. The automaker will work through its usual summer production downtime in North America to help meet consumer demand. READ MORE : Sign up for our weekly coronavirus newsletter here , and read our latest coverage on the crisis here . The automaker's negative cash flow for the first half of 2020 was \u20ac 10 billion, with \u20ac 7.3 billion of that from working capital and provisions impacts, CFO and Head of Business Development Richard Palmer said. The CFO expects a \"substantial part\" of the \u20ac 7.3 billion to reverse positively as Fiat Chrysler restores production levels and dealer inventories, especially in North America. CEO Manley said Fiat Chrysler is on track to reduce overall 2020 costs by about \u20ac2 billion. The second half of 2020 will be also impacted by some planned downtime to retool plants for the production of new vehicles, however, Manley said. This will be partly offset by other vehicle launches, including the new Ram TRX pickup truck to be produced in the fourth quarter, he added. \"We expect the launch of these vehicles and numerous other actions the new leadership team has and continues to take to have a solid impact on their financial performance in the fourth quarter,\" Manley said. Fiat Chrysler is also seeing strong customer demand for its electric vehicles, according to Manley, who said the automaker expects to be compliant with Europe's emissions regulations. The CEO also believes automakers will get into the production of batteries for electric vehicles, similar to Tesla Inc., adding that there will be further information from Fiat Chrysler related to that later in the year. \"But that's the way I think that [original equipment manufacturers] should go, personally,\" Manley said.

View more All News Press Releases Benzinga Detroit's Automakers Are Stepping Up Their Truck Game As we enter the second half of 2020, the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) are stepping up their game in the truck and SUV segment. Despite the fact we are still far from beating the COVID-19 pandemic, the automakers are increasing their capital spending on the EV segment.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Fiat Chrysler delivered a loss of $1.24 billion during the second quarter, which marks a drop of 232% compared to last year's result. But its Stellantis chapter is set to change its circumstances. After its merger with Groupe PSA, Peugeot's maker (OTC: PUGOY), it will revamp its Warren Truck plant, just outside Detroit, to build the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Once completed, it will add a new product to its Jeep line - a three-row SUV capable of going where there are no roads. FCA is confident it can meet the challenge posed by Ford's new line of Broncos.But Ford's new offering does not have a three-row vehicle. And after the merger, FCAU is set to become the world's fourth largest automaker.Ford Ford's Bronco reboot was unveiled last month, after supposedly receiving 100,000 reservations for the two new models. Also, there is the redesigned Ford F-150 that has been postponed fourth quarter. Ford's Chief Financial Officer, Tim Stone, announced an expected profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter. However, he also warned that the launches of the redesigned F-150, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E will result in the company being in the red during the fourth quarter.But the bottom line is that Ford is poised to be in a much better position for 2021 as several new products will be available for sale. Moreover, Ford recently delivered an unexpected profit of $1.1. billion for its second quarter. But it was due to a one-time $3.5 billion gain on its investment with self-driving software Argo AI, recorded on its statement of financial position as a \"special item,\" as otherwise Ford would have delivered a loss like in the first quarter. Its better-than-expected results were attributed to an efficient operational execution that involved a safe restart of its plants while reducing costs, while its efforts were complemented by a favorable pricing environment.General Motors General Motors also announced that it will boost the production of full-size pickup trucks by 1,000 units per month at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant by expanding its workforce. According to its Chief Financial Officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, GM is at the end of a sweeping change in its truck portfolio. The down time in the last three years is behind GM as this will be its new bright spot. But the giant also left its first quarter profit begin as it swung to an $800 million loss in the second quarter and burned $7.8 billion in cash.Trucks In The Age Of Renewables Overall, there are many developments that pickup truck owners and fans can rejoice in. Moreover, there are many new products to look forward to such as Worksport's product line of solar powered tonneau covers for pickup trucks. Worksport (OTC: WKSP) and its three new technologically advanced light truck tonneau covers will be launched in the U.S very soon. Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling pickup truck for more than four decades. But considering these developments, that may no longer be the case.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

Hospitals are running short of drugs to treat Covid-19, intensive care units are close to capacity, and ventilators are running short. Rashida Tlaib pushes to free US inmates from coronavirus 'death sentence\u2019 Read more Between 85% and 90% of the very sick and dying are African American. Amid this gathering storm, the city council met to decide whether to require people to wear masks, a basic protection the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly recommends . Doctors lined up to plead their case. \u201cThis is beyond an epidemic in this area,\u201d said the pulmonologist Bill Saliski. \u201cOur units are full of critically ill covid patients. We have to slow this down.\u201d His colleague, Nina Nelson-Garrett, described watching undertakers carrying out corpses, 30 minutes apart. \u201cSomething as simple as a mask can save someone\u2019s life,\u201d she said. Dr Kim McGlothan recounted how she was frequently stopped by white people asking, \u201cIs the media sensationalizing this, is it really as bad as they are making out?\u201d McGlothan told the council: \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe the hype. Until you mandate masks, we won\u2019t be able to stop this \u2013 we just won\u2019t.\u201d Then a black resident stood up. Six of his relatives had died from Covid-19. His brother was on a ventilator. \u201cThis is not about masks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question on the table is, \u2018Do black lives matter?\u2019 I lost six of my family to Covid. How would it feel if it was your family?\u201d If a pandemic comes through, we do not throw our constitutional rights out the window Brantley Lyons, councilman The council debated for two hours. White council members asked if young children could get carbon monoxide poisoning from masks \u2013 no, the doctors firmly told them \u2013 and spoke portentously about individual rights. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d said councilman Brantley Lyons, \u201cif a pandemic comes through, we do not throw our constitutional rights out the window.\u201d When the vote was called, it divided on largely racial lines. Black members voted for masks, in order to prevent more families losing six loved ones. White members voted against masks, to preserve the fundamental right not to attach a cloth to your face. In a 4-4 tie , the ordinance failed. As he left the chamber, Dr Saliski uttered just one word: \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reopen Alabama protesters demonstrate in Montgomery, Alabama, in April. Photograph: Jake Crandall/AP Unbelievable accurately describes America today. The country is on the brink of a huge surge of Covid-19, as the virus tears through the heartlands while the president praises himself for having done \u201c a great job \u201d and blithely predicts the scourge will \u201c fade away \u201d. Ask Alabama whether the virus is fading away. Or Arizona, Florida, South Carolina or Texas. The disease is venting its fury on these states, which all reopened their economies \u2013 with Donald Trump\u2019s avid blessing \u2013 before the contagion was contained. \u201cOpening while cases are increasing is like leaning into a left hook,\u201d said Tom Frieden, a former CDC director. \u201cYou are basically asking to get hit \u2013 and that\u2019s what these states did.\u201d Alabama is enduring a pummeling. It has recorded 32,000 cases and its curve is on a steep upward path. The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, who ushered in one of the earliest and most aggressive reopenings, insisted a few days ago that his state \u201cremains wide-open for business\u201d. Yet he has been unable to ignore reality: that the virus has spread its lethal tentacles to every corner of the state overwhelming hospitals to the point that Houston medical centers are running out of ICU beds. Now, once again, Texas\u2019 bars are closing . One town, near Houston, has even brought in a curfew. The Lone Star state recorded 6,584 cases on Wednesday alone \u2013 a heart-sinking figure that makes its curve look almost vertical. Florida\u2019s malaise would be wryly amusing were so many lives not at stake. On 20 May the conservative magazine the National Review ran the gloating headline : \u201cWhere Does Ron DeSantis Go to Get His Apology?\u201d The article scolded liberal critics of the Republican governor\u2019s lax approach to coronavirus \u2013 he famously allowed beaches to remain open in spring break and has permitted shops and restaurants to get back to business \u2013 for having got it wrong: there was no spike in Florida. On 20 May, Florida\u2019s daily infection load stood at 527 new cases. Five weeks later, it reported a record 8,942 on Friday and broke the record again on Saturday with 9,585. Play Video 5:28 From miracle cures to slowing testing: how Trump has defied science on coronavirus \u2013 video explainer \u2018It\u2019s getting worse, not better\u2019 Though states such as Florida and Texas are bearing the brunt of the beating, this is not a catastrophe that can be dismissed as the problem of just a few places. Across the nation, at terrifying speed, a similar picture is revealing itself. Every important data point , including positivity rates and hospitalizations, is surging across most states. A map produced by a team of epidemiologists and health experts, Covid Act Now, shows only four states, all in the north-east, including New York, which used to be at the center of the pandemic but has wrestled it under control, as being on track to contain the disease. Twenty-one states are at risk or facing active or imminent outbreaks. The missing six weeks: how Trump failed the biggest test of his life Read more It is troubling enough that the US now has 2.4m confirmed cases \u2013 double the number of the next highest country in the world, Brazil, and almost certainly a huge underestimate . The death toll has passed 12 5,000 , with another 20,000 at least expected this month. The death rate is still trending downwards \u2013 one bit of positive news in this sorry picture. But deaths lag behind confirmed cases by a month, and that spells trouble ahead. One crumb of comfort had been that for almost three months the daily rate of new infections held steady at around 20,000 cases a day. Then, two weeks ago, the monster began to stir. The tally of new cases ticked upwards, and on Thursday it reached a stomach-churning 40,000 \u2013 the worst day on record since the pandemic began. \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse, not better,\u201d said Frieden, who now heads the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives . \u201cThe contrast with other countries is striking. South Korea had 30 cases a day and they flipped out. The US now has 30,000 cases a day and there are people shrugging and saying \u2018It\u2019s no big deal\u2019.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump told a Tulsa rally: \u2018When you do testing you are going to find more cases. So I told my people, slow the testing down.\u2019 Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/AP Trump is shrugger-in-chief. When the president lured thousands of non-mask wearing supporters to a viral incubation party \u2013 he called it a rally \u2013 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last Saturday, he told them that in his view testing for coronavirus was a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u2026 When you do testing you are going to find more cases. So I told my people, slow the testing down.\u201d Despite White House efforts to pass the comment off as a joke , it encapsulates the Trump administration\u2019s approach towards this devastating crisis. Early on, Trump failed to marshal the full weight of the most powerful government on Earth against the virus. He lost six critical weeks . When the conversation turns to, \u2018Why can\u2019t we ramp up testing?\u2019 there\u2019s a sense the White House is not going to be happy Ashish Jha, Harvard Global Health Institute Even today, the 500,000 tests being carried out each day falls woefully short of the scale needed. Contact tracing \u2013 another crucial tool \u2013 is patchy at best, with signs that a growing number of Americans are unwilling to cooperate . Leading public health experts have watched aghast as Trump has done exactly what he said he would: put a dampener on data-driven efforts that could, over the course of the pandemic, potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives. \u201cEverybody agrees we need a lot more testing,\u201d said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \u201cBut when the conversation turns to, \u2018Why can\u2019t we ramp up the testing?\u2019 there\u2019s always the sense that the White House is not going to be happy to do what\u2019s necessary. There\u2019s real pushback against scientific leaders calling for action.\u201d Evidence for such a pushback isn\u2019t hard to find. There\u2019s this week\u2019s announcement that the Trump administration will soon end federal funding for 13 testing sites \u2013 seven in ravaged Texas. Then there\u2019s the ghostlike absence of the CDC, one of the world\u2019s leading public health agencies, which has fallen mute at the moment it is most needed. Frieden has become so frustrated by the booming silence of the institution he led for almost eight years, until Trump entered the White House, he has taken to publicising CDC research himself, in a desperate attempt to fill the void. When the Guardian put it to him that this was an extraordinary state of affairs, Frieden replied: \u201cIt feels a bit like North Korea, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d The most worrying aspect of the tone being set by Trump is that it is starting to shift the mindset of ordinary Americans. Everywhere you look there are anecdotal signs of people falling in line with the president \u2013 shrugging and saying it\u2019s no big deal. That trend is very visible in Montgomery. In the end, the town\u2019s African American mayor, Steven Reed, overruled the city council\u2019s white members and introduced mandatory mask-wearing by executive fiat. But it will be an uphill battle persuading white townsfolk to abide by the ordinance. Brad Harper, a reporter with the Montgomery Advertiser, says he is struck whenever he goes into a Target or Walmart that almost all white shoppers go unmasked while black shoppers have their faces covered. On social media, people rant about masks as \u201cmuzzles\u201d and \u201cbadges of submission\u201d. \u201cPeople get really angry about it, resisting even their doctors asking them to wear it,\u201d Harper said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see a protective device, as something that can save the people around you, they see it as an instrument of control.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest People walk on the Hollywood Beach Boardwalk as Florida reports another surge in coronavirus cases, on 26 June. Photograph: Larry Marano/REX/Shutterstock All across the country, similar acts of personal rebellion are playing out. Residents of Palm Beach, Florida, erupted in anger against a mandatory mask order, calling it the \u201cdevil\u2019s law\u201d and an affront to \u201cGod\u2019s breathing system\u201d. Further up the Florida coast, in Jacksonville Beach, 16 friends decided to have a night out at an Irish pub \u2013 the entire group came down with the virus, as well as seven bar workers. A surprise birthday party in Texas led to 18 members of one family being infected. Crowds of unmasked people have been gathering in Las Vegas\u2019s reopened casinos, and Covid-19 cases have soared . In Arizona, the Republican sheriff of Pinal county vowed not to enforce the lockdown on grounds of individual liberty, and promptly contracted the disease himself. Not to mention Cruisin\u2019 Chubbys Gentleman\u2019s Club , a strip club in Wisconsin that had its very own outbreak. \u2018If you divide people, you allow divide and conquer\u2019 Everywhere you look there are indications America\u2019s social contract \u2013 the idea that if we stand united we can defeat this terrible affliction \u2013 is breaking down. Florida governor under fire over claims state is 'cooking the books' on Covid-19 Read more \u201cIf you divide people, you allow divide and conquer,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cThis is us against them, humans against microbes. The more we are divided, the more microbes will conquer.\u201d W\u00e4ndi Bruine de Bruin, provost professor of public policy, psychology and behavioral science at the University of Southern California, has been tracking the changing public response since March. Through a rolling survey of 7,000 adults, she has found that most Americans \u2013 about 71% \u2013 still say they avoid public spaces and crowds. But the proportion is falling, fast, down from 92% in April. She puts the slide down to unclear messaging. \u201cMessages and policies are no longer consistent. Some businesses are allowed to open, others not, and it\u2019s not clear why. That leads to confusion, and anger. Some people start to think it\u2019s not fair, others start to assume it\u2019s not that important.\u201d Jha said it was vital to acknowledge that most Americans, including many Republicans, have so far been compliant with stay-at-home orders. But he frets that a mindset is taking hold that the virus is somebody else\u2019s problem. \u201cI worry that it will take large numbers of people getting very sick, the hospitals filling up, for people to realise this is a pandemic, not a disease outbreak in New York or New Orleans. I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. I worry that it will.\u201d This is a long war and we are losing a lot of battles right now, because we are not fighting them Tom Frieden The Guardian asked whether he was concerned about possible public resistance to renewed lockdown orders, should some states be forced back into extreme measures in the face of a Covid-19 explosion. \u201cI do fear that,\u201d he said. \u201cFor months there has been a concerted effort by a small minority to argue that this is overblown or a hoax. It will be difficult for Republican leaders to get people to change their views on this.\u201d Jha checked himself, then added: \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny minority. Unfortunately, it includes the president of the United States.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest People visit a self-swabbing coronavirus COVID-19 testing site at the Lilburn First Baptist church in Lilburn, Georgia. Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA The good news is that scientists are very clear about what needs to be done. Frieden calls it the three Ws \u2013 wear a mask, wash your hands, watch your distance \u2013 combined with aggressive testing, contact tracing and isolation of the sick. If such measures can be introduced concertedly and quickly, both at federal and state level, public health experts are confident that all is not lost. The contagion could be contained and the economy slowly and relatively safely rebooted. But time is running out for America. \u201cThis is a long war and we are losing a lot of battles right now, because we are not fighting them,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cWe are going to be paying for the mistakes we make today for months, or even years, to come.\u201d Topics Coronavirus outbreak Donald Trump Infectious diseases US politics features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most popular US Elections 2020 World Environment Soccer US Politics Business Tech Science News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Three analysts interviewed by S&P Global Market Intelligence said the three-month period to June 30, during which the bulk of global auto manufacturing and retail was shuttered amid coronavirus lockdowns, was the most devastating they had witnessed in their career. Of the major automakers with a global presence, analyst polls by S&P Global Market Intelligence show that only South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. are expected to report an operating profit. In absolute terms, U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co. could fare worst with predicted losses of $5 billion, followed by General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. None of the major automakers have been able to offer full-year guidance due to a lack of visibility, but ratings agencies and consultancies have predicted global auto sales to drop 20%-25% in 2020. \"It's not like a normal recessionary scenario where the recession slows activity. This has dropped vertically. That's why we're in unknown territory to a certain extent,\" said Owen Edwards, associate director in the automotive unit at accountancy firm Grant Thornton. \"I would ignore the profitability. It's a question of 'are they cash-strong?' ... Cash management is absolutely critical at this time in order for companies to survive and thrive.\" Edwards said automakers' path out of the recent lockdown could assume a \"W\" shape. This would play out as a strong initial rebound, something already being witnessed in China, followed by a period of slower sales due to weakening consumer confidence that would precede a gradual recovery. Early analyst estimates for the year's remaining two quarters indicate all major carmakers will return to operating profit with the exception of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., which is in the early stages of a turnaround plan. However, many have announced drastic job losses and reduced investments in new technologies in their efforts to achieve this. As one of the biggest employers and manufacturers in numerous major economies, governments have stepped in to help with measures to spur sales, including subsidies. Unlike a decade ago, many of the countries that have announced such initiatives are making this cash available only for the purchase of hybrid and electric cars, which could limit their intended stimulus effect. Other measures include state loan guarantees, such as a \u20ac5 billion credit line that Renault has secured with backing from the French government . Such help may come at a cost, however, if it leaves automakers increasingly beholden to their helpers, according to Jim Saker, director of the Centre for Automotive Management at the Loughborough University in the U.K. When French President Emmanuel Macron in May declared his ambition for the country to become Europe's top producer of low emission vehicles, he also said domestic automakers should avoid transferring production of locally made cars to other locations. Indications that Honda and Nissan will concentrate more production at home in Japan are further signs of a more nationalistic attitude, Saker said. \"You've got governments involved now trying to influence and stabilize the situation, but also putting massive conditions on what the car manufacturers can do. So in reality, they lose choice of location and they lose product range,\" Saker said, referring to government policies nudging automakers to speed up electrification. \"I've argued for a number of years that the motor industry is no longer in control of its own destiny. Now it's been weakened and I think it's in even less control of its destiny as a result of COVID-19.\" Electric-car maker Tesla Inc. is expected to fare better than its U.S. peers, with analysts at Credit Suisse forecasting a 10% quarter-over-quarter drop in total deliveries. CEO Elon Musk suggested in an internal email seen by Electrek that the company may be able to break even for the quarter with a strong final few days. Tesla's resilience may be in part due to a business model that emphasizes online sales, something that anomalously made it the top-selling brand in the U.K. in April and May as rivals' dealerships were shut. This highlights what Christoph Sturmer, global lead analyst at PwC's Autofacts consultancy, said is a flawed practice in Europe. Rather than dealers selling cars from larger stocks held on their premises, the European market tends to operate in a made-to-order fashion, with sales passed on to manufacturers by dealers, resulting in longer waiting times for final delivery. Some of this is related to cars' higher prices in Europe that prompt buyers to keep within budget by handpicking optional extras that come as standard in some other regions. \"What we see is that the Chinese and U.S. sales model that is more stock-based and offers dealers more independence was much more resilient in the crisis than the more centralized and leaner sales models in Europe,\" Sturmer said. \"Everybody was on the [coronavirus] lockdown but the Chinese and U.S. dealer salesperson just took their mobile phone and called their clients.\" Author Peter Murphy Theme Retail & Consumer Products About Us Quality Program Contact Us Email Subscription Center Press Releases Careers Corporate Responsibility Our History Investor Relations Leadership \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Terms of Use Cookie Notice Privacy Policy Disclosures Do Not Sell My Personal Information"},

PSA and FCA said their response to the EU's request for documentation was already in progress, but had been made more complicated to fulfil due to factors including the COVID-19 emergency. It \"will be transmitted shortly\", the two groups said in joint statement. The previous deadline for the EU's decision was Nov. 13. FCA and PSA aim to finalise their merger in the first quarter of next year. It is set to create the world's fourth largest auto maker, to be named \"Stellantis\". The Commission is investigating whether the deal to create the world's fourth-biggest carmaker would hurt competition in small vans in 14 EU countries and Britain.

In a statement, it says: Defendant Ghosn\u2019s allegations completely ignore his own conduct, and his one-sided criticism of the Japanese criminal justice system is totally unacceptable.

Photograph: Mohamed Azakir/Reuters ....followed by Carole Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images Updated at 4.26pm GMT Facebook Twitter 4.07pm GMT 16:07 Carlos Ghosn: What we learned...and what we didn't It was billed as a press conference, but Carlos Ghosn\u2019s long-awaited appearance before the world\u2019s media also felt like a courtroom, with a Powerpoint presentation thrown in too. But this courtroom, unlike the one he has avoided in Tokyo, gave the defendant free rein to explain why he\u2019s innocent, M\u2019Lud. Ghosn spent an hour presenting his own case, and then fended off suggestions that his fugitive status implies guilt. But what did we learn? 1) Ghosn blames a conspiracy between Nissan executives and forces within the Japanese government to bring him down. He named former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, whistleblower Hari Nada and board member Masakazu Toyoda, adding: My unimaginable ordeal is the result of a handful of unscrupulous, vindictive individuals. He refused to name which government officials are to blame, beyond appearing to absolve PM Shinzo Abe. 2) Japan\u2019s judicial system is in the spotlight. Ghosn makes a fair point when he criticises the Japanese habit of forcing confessions out of those accused of crimes. Pouring out his anguish, the former CEO said: I was brutally taken from my work as I knew it, ripped from my work, my family and my friends. It is impossible to express the depth of that deprivation and my profound appreciation to be able to be reunited with my family and loved ones. (I was) interrogated for up eight hours a day without any lawyers present. \u2018It will get worse for you if you don\u2019t just confess\u2019, the prosecutor told me repeatedly. 3) Ghosn claims he has proof that he\u2019s innocent . Reporters were shown some documents which -- apparently -- explain away the $11m of dubious expense payments. He also produced a letter approving the houses bought for the Ghosn family, signed by Saikawa. Ghosn says he plans to prove his innocence. I don\u2019t consider myself as a prisoner in Lebanon. I prefer this prison to the one before. I am ready to stay a long time in Lebanon, but I am going to fight because I have to clear my name. 4) He\u2019s burned his bridges in Japan. Savaging the Tokyo prosecutor is one thing. But citing Pearl Harbor as an example of Japanese cunning and secrecy is to deploy the diplomatic skills of Basil Fawlty. Ghosn\u2019s point is that he didn\u2019t spot how his one-time allies were plotting to boot him out, to break Renault\u2019s control over Nissan - and scupper a planned merged with Fiat-Crysler. But still, it was a poor analogy that will distract from Ghosn\u2019s claims of innocence. 5) He\u2019s devoted to Mrs Ghosn. I think Ghosn was trying to be chivalrous when he joked that he missed his wife badly when he was trapped in Japan, even if others might not . As he touchingly put it: I\u2019ve been in a kind of nightmare for 13 months. It started when I saw the face of the prosecutor, and it ended when I saw the face of my wife. This love is not unrequited -- Carole has spoken about how her husband\u2019s return was a \u201cbeautiful surprise\u201d . They share something else too -- charges in Japan. In her case, prosecutors claim she committed perjury last year. Former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn arrives with his wife Carole today Photograph: -/AFP via Getty Images 6) Lebanon might not be as safe as he hoped. Fleeing to Beirut looked like a cunning plan, as there\u2019s no extradition treaty with Japan. But there is a law banning travel to Israel, which Ghosn has broken in the past. Beirut\u2019s prosecutor wants to discuss this with Ghosn tomorrow, alongside the Red Notice issued by Interpol for his arrest. 7) Be honest, you were hoping to hear Ghosn confirm whether he was bundled out of Toyko in a big musical box. I certainly was . But on this point, he remained tight-lipped. Perhaps he\u2019s saving it for the film version (although he denies that there\u2019s a deal with Netflix). Updated at 4.14pm GMT Facebook Twitter 3.26pm GMT 15:26 After two and half hours, Carlos Ghosn\u2019s press conference is ending as it began, with the former car chief insisting he is innocent. If I\u2019d had any hope of a fair trial, I\u2019d never have fled, he says. He also criticises prosecutors for issuing an arrest warrant for his wife Carole, for allegedly giving false information. Why do that nine months afterwards? And with that, he\u2019s finished. Facebook Twitter 3.21pm GMT 15:21 Q: Are you the Dreyfus of Lebanon? Ghosn says he doesn\u2019t understand the reference (to Alfred Dreyfus, the French captain, who was wrongly convicted of passing military secrets to Germany). Q: It means are you a victim? Yes I am, says Ghosn firmly. He says that several law professors say they cannot understand why he was arrested, especially as some of the alleged financial misconduct refers to money that wasn\u2019t even paid out. Facebook Twitter 3.17pm GMT 15:17 Ghosn: It's been a 13-month nightmare Q: What were your emotions during your escape? Ghosn says he was numb, from the start of the drama until he met his wife Carole in her parents\u2019 home in the Lebanon. I\u2019ve been in a kind of nightmare for 13 months. It started when I saw the face of the prosecutor, and it ended when I saw the face of my wife. Q: Would you recommend a packing case as a mode of travel? Ghosn breaks into a grin, but won\u2019t confirm that rumour that he was smuggled out of Japan in a large box. Facebook Twitter 3.13pm GMT 15:13 Q: Can the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance succeed without you? Yes, says Ghosn modestly - but it needs to follow some rules. Facebook Twitter 3.13pm GMT 15:13 Ghosn says he is ready to answer questions from the French authorities, who last year launched an inquiry into his wealth . Facebook Twitter 3.09pm GMT 15:09 Incidentally, the much-pined-after Carole Ghosn is attending today\u2019s press conference, supporting her man. Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images Facebook Twitter 3.06pm GMT 15:06 Ghosn: I missed my wife (even if you wouldn't) Associated Press asks Ghosn what triggered his decision to escape Japan. Ghosn says there were two factors. First, the Tokyo prosecutor kept postponing his trial, saying it wouldn\u2019t begin until 2021. Second, he missed his wife Carole, telling reporters that: For many people, it wouldn\u2019t be a punishment not to see their wife. But for me it was. How sweet. And yet, how rude! Updated at 3.09pm GMT Facebook Twitter 3.01pm GMT 15:01 Channel Four asks Ghosn about the damage to his reputation: Q: Won\u2019t people say that \u2018if a man escapes from a trial in a box there\u2019s no smoke without fire\u2019? Ghosn won\u2019t be lured into confirming the details of his escape. He says many lies have been told about him, and repeats that he wants a fair trial over the claims of financial misconduct. Updated at 3.01pm GMT Facebook Twitter 2.59pm GMT 14:59 Ghosn has reiterated that he had talked to Fiat-Chrysler about a possible merger with Renault, but the deal floundered after his arrest (allowing Peugeot to swoop in instead). Facebook Twitter 2.56pm GMT 14:56 Curiously, Ghosn denies that he resigned from Renault, saying such reports are a \u201ctravesty\u201d. That\u2019s odd, as France\u2019s finance minister Bruno Le Maire announced a year ago that Ghosn had quit as Renault\u2019s chairman and CEO . Renault also announced that he had resigned both roles , but remained as a director.

The rating agency said FCA will likely recover gradually in 2021 following a drop in global vehicle sales in 2020. It also noted the company's low investment-grade business characteristics, including large scale and broad product- and geographic diversification. Fitch said the Italian-American automaker operating margin could decline to about 2% in 2020. The gravity of the impact will depend on the duration and extent of the production stoppages and sales decline as a result of the pandemic. READ MORE : Sign up for our weekly coronavirus newsletter here , and read our latest coverage on the crisis here . In addition, the agency said FCA 's profitability recovery will depend on the success of cost-saving initiatives and new product launches. FCA 's ratings assume that the company's potential merger with Peugeot SA will proceed, Fitch said. \"We believe that this merger will support FCA's credit profile recovery, in a more difficult environment than expected given the pandemic. If the merger does not proceed as planned this will add negative pressure to FCA's rating,\" the agency added. However, Fitch said the plan to pay an exceptional \u20ac5.5 billion dividend to align valuations in the merger will compound free cash flow absorption and weigh significantly on leverage. Funds from operations net leverage could rise to more than 1.5x by the end of 2020. According to Fitch, an upgrade of FCA's ratings is unlikely until the global environment normalizes. However, it said it could still upgrade the ratings if free cash flow margin is around 2% and if funds from operations net leverage is around 0.5x. Meanwhile, the rating agency said it could downgrade the ratings if the merger with Peugeot falls apart, or if free cash flow margin falls below 1% and if funds from operations net leverage goes above 1.5x.

Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) Some investors have been confused by remarks. To clarify, I am confident the president will do the right thing in temporarily shutting down the country and closing the borders. If that happens, we can win the war against the virus and the markets and the economy will soar. March 18, 2020 He might be right - which his $1.7bn bank balance suggests.

Facebook Twitter 6.22pm GMT 18:22 US airlines want $50bn - spent $45bn on own shares and execs Negotiations are now underway to bail out the airlines. Delta announced today that it is going to cut 70% of its flights.

We won\u2019t let this to look like the bank bailout of 2008, nor can you compare the two.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) NASDAQ UP 72.2% SINCE OUR GREAT 2016 ELECTION VICTORY! DOW UP 55.8%. The best is yet to come! December 23, 2019 Presidents usually avoid boasting about the stock market, aware that today\u2019s gains can be wiped out by tomorrow\u2019s events. It\u2019s a lesson Trump is learning the hard way. Covid-19 has now erased all the stock market gains of the Trump presidency. After his last speech, markets fell so hard they were temporarily stopped. Now they are open again and still falling. The Dow is now down 9%. Updated at 5.54pm GMT Facebook Twitter 5.21pm GMT 17:21 Up and falling Trading has resumed and the falls continue. Some are blaming it on Trump. Here\u2019s Dan Alpert, investment banker and credit bubble expert: Dan Alpert (@DanielAlpert) And that's it. @realDonaldTrump literally succeeded in tanking the market - shutting it down as it hits it circuit breaker limit loss. He actually did it...the very stable genius! https://t.co/VI2kColI1Z March 18, 2020 Facebook Twitter 5.05pm GMT 17:05 Markets closed down - again Trading has stopped again after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,660 points, or 7.8%, and the S&P 500 dropped over 7%. The indexes are down about 30% from their mid-February highs. Everything is falling today. Oil has plunged 15% to its lowest level in more than 18 years. Gold, usually a safe haven in times of panic, is down 1%. Looks like people want to cash out - they want to take their money and head for the hills until this blows over.

Says he has been in isolation recently because of fears he could carry the virus and pass it to older, vulnerable people including his dad. Ackman says he has never carried more than $200 in cash but went to the bank recently and took out \u201ca large amount of money\u201d. \u201cCapitalism does not work in an 18 month shutdown,\u201d he says. The Trump administration needs to close everything down in order to get rid of the virus as quickly as possible. \u201cThis is the only answer.\u201d If we don\u2019t jump on this now \u201cAmerica as we know it will end\u201d. Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) Mr. President, the moment you send everyone home for Spring Break and close the borders, the infection rate will plummet, the stock market will soar, and the clouds will lift.

The Business Roundtable, which speaks for dozens of major US companies including Apple, General Motors, JP Morgan Chase and WalMart, wants a suspension of global tariffs, a temporary halt to payrolls taxes and measures to support the supply chain. The government actions necessary to address this crisis will have enormous costs,\u201d the letter, signed by Walmart boss Doug McMillon, said. \u201cHowever, failure to act boldly now will impose far greater costs to our country and our future.\u201d Updated at 5.52pm GMT Facebook Twitter 4.27pm GMT 16:27 European markets close down - US markets are still falling European markets are now closed after another bad day.

Moody's also placed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's ratings on review with direction uncertain and downgraded Bayerische Motoren Werke AG's long-term issuer rating to A2 from A1. The German carmaker's ratings are also under review for further downgrade. The agency said its review on Fiat Chrysler balances the challenges the entire auto industry is facing. However, Moody's said it still believes that the Italian American company's proposed merger with Peugeot will result in a higher rating compared to Fiat Chrysler's current rating. Meanwhile, Moody's said its decision to downgrade BMW was driven by the company's already weak positioning in the A1 rating category even before the coronavirus outbreak came to light. In assessing the affected companies' ratings, Moody's said it will look into the outbreak's impact on the automakers' manufacturing operations, including the impact from the temporary closures and the decline in global automotive production. The rating agency said it could consider raising the companies' ratings if the market situation stabilizes, leading to a recovery in metrics, and if adjusted debt/EBITDA drops back sustainably below 1x with an EBITA margin sustainably above 8%. Moody's added that a further downgrade could result from BMW's failure to return to meaningful operating profit generation in the second half of 2020. The agency said it expects to solve the review process within the next three months.
