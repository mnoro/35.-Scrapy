Miners slumped the most, trimming sharp gains made on Wednesday, after Glencore scrapped its 2020 dividend. Insurers also underperformed after AXA SA abandoned some growth targets and canceled a payout, while Munich Re withdrew its 2020 guidance. Credit Agricole SA dropped after setting aside more in bad-loan provisions than expected.Equities have lost steam after surging to a four-month high in late July, as investors question whether much of the economic recovery is already priced in and assess the risk of it being derailed by rising coronavirus cases.

Bloomberg It\u2019s Time for Glencore to\u00a0Embrace Change (Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ivan Glasenberg has built up a formidable\u00a0commodities giant. The Glencore chief executive officer\u2019s resolute belief in the counter-cyclical value of a trading business paid\u00a0off in the first half of 2020, with\u00a0an oil bonanza that helped ease blows dealt by the coronavirus. Impairments still dragged it\u00a0to a $2.6 billion net loss.\u00a0The past two years haven\u2019t been kind: The group is still under investigation over possible corrupt practices, coal has\u00a0crumbled and the stock has underperformed traditional mining heavyweights.\u00a0Glencore could do worse than to take the pandemic hint and revamp its investment proposition, with\u00a0less of the black stuff\u00a0and greener assets to get ahead of peers in a sector that hasn\u2019t been a leader in environmental, social and governance terms. That might include completing a long-signposted change at the top.\u00a0All but one of the old guard of divisional heads who became billionaires alongside Glasenberg when the miner and trader listed in 2011 have now left. With a\u00a0shift away from past\u00a0fiefdoms and a new generation in place, the company can at last outline an exit date, a new boss\u00a0and its next act.Not all of the group\u2019s troubles are within its control, or indeed avoidable. It can\u2019t speed up investigations, and is already cooperating. Meanwhile, an unexpected, gravity-defying\u00a0surge in iron ore, which Glencore\u00a0doesn\u2019t mine, has masked plenty of problems at rival diggers. The Covid-19 pandemic also took its toll:\u00a0Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the first six months came in at a\u00a0forecast-beating $4.8 billion, but still fell 13%. It wrote $3.2 billion off the\u00a0value of Colombian coal, Chadian oil, African copper and Peruvian zinc. Even its oil trading win\u00a0pushed up a debt burden already higher than most peers, and forced the company\u00a0to scrap dividends for the year.It\u00a0can, though,\u00a0tell a better story, at a\u00a0time when even oil majors are going green.That involves, first and foremost,\u00a0tackling coal. It still\u00a0helps\u00a0fund Glencore\u2019s more eco-friendly activities like\u00a0battery ingredients copper, cobalt and nickel, but coal margins have shrunk to 23%, half where they were in 2018, and that\u2019s not just a temporary coronavirus hit. The world\u2019s largest thermal coal exporter\u00a0capped production last year, and said last week it would cut back in light of oversupply. Glencore\u00a0has resisted more dramatic strategic moves, arguing the material can recover, given limited new supply and Asian demand, and remain profitable,\u00a0and that it doesn\u2019t make up enough of its earnings\u00a0to scare investors. With demand in places like Vietnam looking less bright, and ESG pressures only increasing, that\u2019s\u00a0a challenging argument to defend.\u00a0Options include spinning off coal assets (thermal and less significant coking coal), following the path set by BHP Group with South32 Ltd.\u00a0Fund manager distaste for an\u00a0all-coal business, though, may push it toward\u00a0a private solution, if enough backers can be found to build a coal powerhouse to feed Asian buyers. That\u2019s looking cheaper than a year or so ago: Assuming annual Ebitda\u00a0of roughly $1.3\u00a0billion\u00a0for 2020 at current prices, and the multiples on which coal\u00a0rivals like Whitehaven Coal Ltd. trade, a specialized entity could be worth roughly $9\u00a0billion. Neither of these alternatives is yet on the table. Keeping it isn\u2019t impossible, of course, but as with BP Plc and oil, Glencore\u00a0may\u00a0require more evidence of a change of focus,\u00a0perhaps even the retirement of its former coal trader boss.\u00a0Parting company will be a challenge. Glasenberg\u2019s pugnacious charisma has been key to Glencore\u2019s lure. When it listed in 2011, as the rest of the mining industry was cleaning up after wasteful deals and over-priced projects, he was among the first to press for a focus on returns. He wasn\u2019t only a leader, but a major shareholder with skin in the game, as he liked to remind investors.\u00a0That glow hasn\u2019t faded entirely and he is still the second-largest owner, but Glencore\u00a0shares are worth less than half what they were less than a decade ago.\u00a0Including\u00a0reinvested dividends, the stock has generated a negative 51% total return for investors since 2011. Not all African operations have lived up to expectations, and even trading hasn\u2019t been consistent.After his departure, Glasenberg will remain a strong voice, with 9% of the stock, a holding\u00a0he has said he won\u2019t sell under his replacement. It might be a good time to give a well-established\u00a0board a few new faces.Yet Glencore\u2019s traders have always been famed for their impeccable timing. With ESG the company is falling worryingly behind, and not just with coal. It has shifted investment plans to green metals and has a credible\u00a02035 target for closely watched Scope 3 emissions, the greenhouse gases released by clients, but it\u2019s one that relies largely on the inaction of allowing assets to deplete. The company recorded six fatalities in the first half, and embarrassingly few women at the top.

Motley Fool Bloomberg Trump\u2019s WeChat Ban Brings Cold War With China Into a Billion Homes (Bloomberg) -- With the stroke of a pen, Donald Trump made his strategic fight with China hit home for potentially billions of people -- generating confusion, panic and fear around the globe.The U.S. president\u2019s move to ban the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat in just over six weeks from now sent shockwaves through the tech industry and the many American businesses who rely on the apps to sell goods in China.The decision also spurred alarm on Chinese social media, with WeChat users in the U.S. posting contact information so friends and family could reach them if the app disappeared. An online forum popular with stock investors asked users if they would give up their iPhones or WeChat if Apple Inc. eliminated the app from its store: They voted to ditch their phones by a margin of 20 to one.Of all Trump\u2019s shots against China, from imposing tariffs to battling Huawei Technologies Co. to ending Hong Kong\u2019s special trading status, the executive orders against TikTok and WeChat potentially have the widest impact. Beyond the financial blow, they threaten to sever communication links among the people of the world\u2019s biggest economies in addition to spurring a decoupling of the tech industry that could ripple around the world.\u201cThis move points to a hegemonic war -- the U.S. is trying to suppress China\u2019s rise as a super power,\u201d said Yik Chan Chin, who researches global media and communications policy at the Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou. \u201cAll these things will leave a bad impression in China, and the tide of nationalism is already very high right now.\u201dIt\u2019s hard to overstate how ingrained WeChat and Tencent are in China and among its diaspora: WeChat, which has more than 1 billion users and is owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd., is relied upon so heavily that many people have never exchanged phone numbers or emails. From Wal-Mart Inc. and Starbucks Corp. to the NBA and Nike Inc., nearly every major American consumer brand with business in China is deeply intertwined with Tencent and its network, which includes WeChat and investee JD.com.Jason Gui, co-founder of San Francisco-based startup Vue Smart Glasses, said his team has to rely on WeChat to communicate with suppliers in China and a ban would be very \u201cdisruptive.\u201d Emails sent to manufacturers in China are often unanswered for days, whereas inquiries through WeChat will get immediate attention, he said.\u201cWhen the U.S. imposes these bans, they may not realize how intertwined the relationships between U.S. and China have become,\u201d he said. \u201cOur communication lifeline with China depends on WeChat. It hurts small businesses that have limited resources to figure out how to circumvent these bans.\u201d\u2018Hot War\u2019China officially reacted with caution on Friday, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin defending the companies and saying the U.S. \u201cis using national security as an excuse and using state power to oppress non-American businesses.\u201d Just a day earlier, Foreign Minister Wang Yi tried to offer an olive branch by urging the U.S. to \u201creject decoupling\u201d and stop \u201cany attempt to artificially create a so-called \u2018new Cold War.\u2019\u201d Yang Jiechi, a Politburo member, said the door for talks with the U.S. is still open.Trump\u2019s administration has stepped up its campaign against China in recent weeks, betting that a hard line against Beijing will help him win November\u2019s election despite upsetting millions of younger TikTok users. The U.S. also announced on Friday it is placing sanctions on 11 Chinese officials and their allies in Hong Kong, including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, over their role in curtailing political freedoms in the former U.K. colony.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo meanwhile has urged American companies to bar Chinese applications from their app stores, part of his \u201cClean Network\u201d guidance designed to prevent China from accessing the personal data of U.S. citizens. Pompeo\u2019s comments have generated alarm in China. Hu Xijin, editor of the Communist Party\u2019s Global Times newspaper, suggested a division of the internet that stifles commerce and ties between people would prompt the risk of a \u201chot war\u201d to rise.But for many U.S. officials, the bans are simple reciprocity. China walled off its own online sphere years ago, creating an alternate universe where Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. stood in for Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.Yet while President Xi Jinping was an early proponent of cyber-sovereignty, China\u2019s view has changed as its tech champions have become fierce global competitors. By banning certain apps, the U.S. is also looking to deprive China of valuable data that is essential for honing the algorithms that will fuel the modern economy powered by artificial intelligence.The U.S. also potentially has a lot to lose in terms of soft power. Beyond angering the roughly 5 million Chinese Americans, and hundreds of thousands of Chinese students in America, there\u2019s also the risk that other countries start to ban U.S. technology.\u2018Awful for America\u2019\u201cPretty much any large country can kick out Facebook and make their own social network if they want to legislate that,\u201d said Matthew Brennan, managing director of marketing consultancy China Channel. \u201cThat would be awful for America. But that\u2019s the road we\u2019re going towards with this kind of legislation.\u201dWhile the short-term economic impact won\u2019t be large, the decoupling of the tech industries will ultimately lead to slower global growth in the long run, according to Shaun Roache, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. And they could ultimately be more significant than the trade deal, which is one of the few areas of cooperation that remain.\u201cThese sorts of measures on technology are as serious if not more serious than tariffs because these are the growth industries of the futures,\u201d Roache said. \u201cOnce you erect barriers how do you take them down? That\u2019s the question.\u201d(Updates with Hong Kong sanctions detail in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Bloomberg Power Traders Flock to Japan And Its $136 Billion Market (Bloomberg) -- Some of the world\u2019s biggest energy traders are looking to get ahead in Japan\u2019s nascent power market.From Royal Dutch Shell Plc to German utility RWE AG, companies are hiring, reassigning staff and building relationships with Japanese firms to profit in the $136 billion market. After building mature markets in Europe and the U.S., they have their sights on the third-biggest economy, which is taking shape the way European trading did 20 years ago.While western markets are increasingly dominated by renewable energy and shrinking profit margins, the potential for price volatility and arbitrage in Japan are a trader\u2019s dream: It has four distinct seasons, a growing supply of intermittent renewables, an uncertain future for its massive nuclear fleet and two separate grids, not to mention a heavy reliance on imports of natural gas, which many of the new entrants already trade.\u201cI\u2019m confident Japan will be the next big market,\u201d said Steffen Riediger, a director at European Energy Exchange AG, which launched a service to clear futures trades in May. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a market that is developing fast.\u201dEuropean companies are adopting various strategies. Swedish utility Vattenfall AB plans to hire a futures trader for its German trading office, while RWE has established a subsidiary in Tokyo. From there, the German company plans to be active in the physical and financial trading.RWE has been talking to regulators and exchanges since the market fully liberalized in 2016, said Peter Krembel, chief commercial officer at RWE\u2019s trading unit.\u201cWe are already involved in trading fuels into Japan, so we are familiar with the fuel component for the power generation, and it would be very complimentary to trade electricity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is what makes it attractive.\u201dShell was an early mover into the country, setting up a desk in 2018 in a bid to trade the physical power market. That requires a local presence, supply contracts and a deep understanding of the market and its customers.Buying and selling derivatives, on the other hand, can be done from anywhere, making the barrier to entry far lower. The company declined to comment on how its operations have developed.Of 13 foreign firms seeking to trade Japanese power products, four have opened or are planning to open an office in Tokyo, according to traders and company spokespeople surveyed by Bloomberg.ExpansionWhile many companies had their eye on the market since the liberalization four years ago, it wasn\u2019t until Tokyo Commodity Exchange started a futures trading in September and EEX\u2019s launch of clearing services that expansion began in earnest.Still, it\u2019s seen by many companies as essential to speak Japanese to be a credible presence. Additionally, transparency of supply and demand is nothing like in Europe, where millions of data points are available for everything from Spanish solar power to Norwegian hydro production.\u201cJapan is comparable to the European power market in 2000 - there is a functioning day-ahead market and the prospects are interesting,\u201d said Frank van Doorn, head of trading at Vattenfall.Other liberalized Asian markets, such as Australia or Singapore, can\u2019t compete with Japan in terms of size. Traded volume on Japan\u2019s day-ahead physical power contract has ballooned since 2016 and passed one terawatt-hour for the first time earlier this month, nearly double the amount traded on a given day in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest physical market.\u201cWith volumes hitting 1 terawatt-hour, or 40% of the total demand, it\u2019s crucial that domestic participants have the ability to effectively hedge these risks in the futures market,\u201d James Whistler, the global head of energy derivatives at Simpson Spence Young, said by email.SSY began providing brokering services for Japan power this year.Renewable energy, excluding hydro, accounts for 7% of Japan\u2019s power mix now, with solar the biggest contributor. The government\u2019s goal is to reach between 22% and 24% by 2030.Although not an ambitious target, growth in intermittent renewables will make prices more volatile and EEX is betting that\u2019ll boost the need for more companies to become active in the futures market, EEX\u2019s Riediger said.But progress of the derivatives market, which foreign firms are most interested in tapping, has so far been slow.The hesitance comes from the lack of local interest in derivatives. Utilities have largely dragged their feet in joining the futures market, leaving liquidity wallowing near zero, as they pass most costs off to the consumer. Meanwhile, the nation\u2019s 600 registered electricity retailers have shown limited interest in hedging or paper trading.In July, 35.7 gigawatt-hours, or 0.0357 terawatt-hours, of Japanese power derivatives were cleared on TOCOM and EEX, a tiny fraction of the 213 terawatt-hours in Germany.Futures trading is unlikely to grow without more regulatory reforms, according to BloombergNEF. Removing regulated retail power rates and mandating disclosure of bilateral power contracts would help put futures on equal footing with opaque company-to-company contracts, which remain the most popular form of hedging, BNEF analysts said in a June report.\u201cThe market in Japan is still in its infancy,\u201d said RWE\u2019s Krembel. \u201cHowever, the Japanese government together with the exchanges and market participants have created a promising market environment.\u201dTradable liquidity should appear within the next 12-24 months, according to Tobias Davis at Tullett Prebon, which has employed a dedicated power broker in Tokyo.\u201cDerivatives are still quite a new concept to power-market participants within Japan,\u201d Davis said by email. \u201cWe are confident over time a healthy marketplace will emerge.\u201dThe below companies are currently trading, registered to trade or are exploring setting up a desk to cover Japan power, according to press releases, spokespeople and Tocom\u2019s website.ShellRWEVattenfallEngie SATrafigura GroupElectroRoute Energy Trading LtdMacquarie Group LtdUniper SEMunich Re Trading LLCEpoch Capital Pty LtdTotal SE(Updates with BNEF comment in fifth paragraph from the end.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Spain has had the biggest drop in output in the second quarter, with a GDP decline of 18.5%.\nPhotograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images The full extent of the impact of Covid-19 on the eurozone economy has been laid bare by figures showing the single currency zone shrank by a record 12.1% in the second quarter of 2020. Amid growing fears that Europe\u2019s tentative recovery is about to be affected by a second wave of the crisis, the European Union\u2019s statistical arm, Eurostat, provided stark evidence of the drop in activity caused by the almost total lockdowns imposed by some countries in the spring. Eurostat\u2019s data revealed that the contraction in the second quarter \u2013 when combined with a smaller fall in the first three months of the year \u2013 had wiped out a decade and a half of expansion, returning the eurozone economy to its level in the mid-2000s. Italy \u2013 which has struggled to grow since adopting the single currency \u2013 has seen its GDP return to the levels of the mid-1990s. In Spain, where concerns about a second wave are most acute, there has been the biggest drop in output in the second quarter, registering a decline in GDP of 18.5%. The fall, unmatched even during its civil war of the 1930s, followed a contraction of 5.2% in the first quarter and means that the eurozone\u2019s fourth-biggest economy shrank by almost a quarter in the first half of 2020. France, second in size only to Germany within the 19-nation single currency area, saw its GDP drop by 13.8%, while the next biggest economy, Italy, contracted by 12.4%. Germany , which reported its growth figures on Thursday, was the least bad performer of the eurozone\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d economies with a GDP contraction of 10.1% in the second quarter. The best performing countries in the eurozone were in eastern Europe and the Baltic states. Eurostat said that taken as a whole, the eurozone economy was 15% smaller than it had been a year earlier. The record-breaking drop in the April to June period of 2020 followed a fall of 3.6% in the first three months of the year and zero growth in the final quarter of 2019. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at the consultancy firm Capital Economics , said: \u201cThere are few silver linings in the data published today, which confirm that eurozone GDP slumped just as much as feared in the second quarter and that inflation remained well below target. While parts of the economy have sprung back to life over the past couple of months, the damage already done combined with the current and potential future impact of the virus mean that the recovery will be painfully slow.\u201d Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Despite the unprecedented drop in GDP in the second quarter, the worst of the economic damage from Covid-19 was caused in April and activity started to pick up in May and June as lockdown restrictions were eased. But analysts warned that full recovery would be a long process. \u201cThe hard part of this recovery is set to start about now,\u201d said Bert Colijn, senior Eurozone economist at ING Bank. \u201cFirst of all, slightly higher trending new Covid-19 cases increase the risk of reversed reopenings, and we\u2019re already seeing local signs of that. Secondly, from this point on, cautious increases in unemployment and bankruptcies and weak investment will bring to light more characteristics of a general economic slump. These factors are likely to drag on for some time, making a swift recovery to pre-corona levels of GDP out of the question.\u201d Topics Eurozone Economics Coronavirus outbreak France Italy Germany Euro news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story UK catering firm cuts jobs, saying Covid-19 may mean no sport crowds until 2021 Premier League and cricket caterer Levy UK told casual staff \u2018no prospect\u2019 of catered events this year Published: 9 Aug 2020 UK catering firm cuts jobs, saying Covid-19 may mean no sport crowds until 2021 As eurozone records 3.8% slump ECB chief warns of worse to come Christine Lagarde says there could be a 15% collapse after record first quarter output fall Published: 30 Apr 2020 As eurozone records 3.8% slump ECB chief warns of worse to come Evening Standard to cut one-third of staff as Covid-19 hits advertising Print edition of London paper will remain but focus will shift to digital and mobile platforms Published: 7 Aug 2020 Evening Standard to cut one-third of staff as Covid-19 hits advertising Thousands of BA staff to find out if they will lose jobs due to Covid More than 6,000 workers accept voluntary redundancy as airline makes cuts Published: 7 Aug 2020 Thousands of BA staff to find out if they will lose jobs due to Covid Fear and mistrust as eurozone ministers debate reconstruction Published: 6 Apr 2020 Fear and mistrust as eurozone ministers debate reconstruction The coronavirus crisis has brought the EU\u2019s failings into sharp relief Larry Elliott Published: 29 Mar 2020 Published: 29 Mar 2020 The coronavirus crisis has brought the EU\u2019s failings into sharp relief Travelex falls into administration, with loss of 1,300 jobs Published: 6 Aug 2020 Travelex falls into administration, with loss of 1,300 jobs LGH Hotels plans to cut hundreds of jobs due to coronavirus pandemic Published: 6 Aug 2020 LGH Hotels plans to cut hundreds of jobs due to coronavirus pandemic More more on this story Most popular News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Two hours later, a handful of Wetherspoons pubs will be among the first in the country to pour pints for anyone nursing a thirst at such an early hour. \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d, as it has been called, offers a rare glimmer of hope for an industry that has been staring into the abyss since the coronavirus pandemic hit. Of England\u2019s 37,500 pubs, about 28,000 are capable of opening under a physical distancing requirement of 1 metre, according to the British Beer and Pubs Association. About 60%, or 22,000, are planning to do so from this week, bringing an end to three-and-a-half long, dry months. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Physical distancing measures in place at BrewDog Tower Hill , London. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images Yet the mood is not entirely merry. Nerves are jangling in the publican fraternity, as cautious optimism is tempered by anxiety about what lies in store for the next 24 hours and beyond. \u201cPeople are frightened of opening tomorrow,\u201d says Dave Mountford, landlord of the Boat In at Cromford, Derbyshire, and long-time pubs campaigner. \u201cThey\u2019re being forced into it because they can\u2019t afford not to.\u201d Protective measures are already in place, such as staff wearing \u201cbeer goggles\u201d and traffic light systems at the toilets . Yet the remaining pitfalls are legion, from marauding drinkers causing trouble to shortages of beer, food and even security staff. Facebook Twitter Pinterest It\u2019s been a long, dry three-and-a-half months for pubs. Photograph: Simon Newman/Reuters At the top of the list of concerns is the capricious local interpretation of government guidelines. Experts fear overzealous police and council officials will attempt to shut down pubs on spurious grounds. Sarah Clover of Kings Chambers, a leading barrister on licensing law, says: \u201cEnforcers often do not understand the difference between guidance and law. \u201cThe first licensees who put their head above the parapet are going to be descended upon by an army of agencies looking to see if they\u2019re doing it wrong. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get people telling retailers like Primark they\u2019d close them down because they don\u2019t have the power to do that, but they do with licensees. \u201cThey [publicans] are very nervous that enforcers are going to do this because they can and, in my opinion, some of them will. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Physical distancing measures in place at booths and banquettes at BrewDog Tower Hill in London. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images \u201cYou\u2019ll have rogue licensees and rogue enforcers and it\u2019s a toxic mix that we\u2019ll see played out big time over the weekend.\u201d Part of the problem, says Clover, is that the guidelines are ambiguous. For instance, they suggest playing music and live sports quietly so that people don\u2019t shout over the noise, increasing the risk of spreading the virus. At local level, says Clover, some police services have erroneously told publicans that they\u2019re not allowed to show football. Liz Hind, landlady of the Old Millwrights Arms in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is delaying her reopening for 24 hours, preferring to wait for the more sedate Sunday dog-walkers\u2019 crowd. But even she fears the tap on the shoulder from police, licensing officers or environmental health. \u201cWe asked for information three weeks ago but we only got the government guidelines 10 days ago,\u201d she says. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Most bars will operate a non-cash payment system. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to interpret them but who knows if it will be good enough. \u201cWe know they\u2019ve got the power to come in and just close us down and we are expecting that they\u2019ll use that in some cases, even though we\u2019re all just trying to do our best in really difficult circumstances.\u201d Such trepidation is echoed across the industry but some fear more fundamental obstacles, such as shortages of beer and food. \u201cA lot of brewers only started brewing last week and certain products take a few weeks to brew,\u201d says Joanne Cox-Brown, director of Night Time Economy Solutions. \u201cThere could be similar issues on food, too.\u201d In some areas, bouncers are said to be in short supply, a headache given the potentially heady mix of constrained capacity with nearly four months of pent-up rowdiness . \u201cWe\u2019re seeing security staff who aren\u2019t keen on coming back after working in retail or other industries, where they\u2019re paid the same money for more regular hours,\u201d says Cox-Brown. The prevailing mood in the pubs trade is that Saturday was a bad choice for unleashing England\u2019s pubgoers. Facebook Twitter Pinterest James McAlister, manager at the Morning Star Bar and Restaurant in Belfast, who said it had been a great feeling to reopen the doors on Friday morning following lockdown. Photograph: Rebecca Black/PA Indeed, some of the UK\u2019s biggest pub companies have taken a wait-and-see approach. Greene King won\u2019t be opening any of its 1,700 pubs on Saturday, waiting instead for the rather calmer Monday trade. London-based Young\u2019s isn\u2019t serving until later in July and Fuller\u2019s is only opening 27 out of 215 this weekend, phasing them in after that. But the flip side of anxiety about overcrowding on Saturday night is the concern that not enough people will return to make pubs viable. Of 25,000 people surveyed by FindOutNow, 93% plan to give \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d a miss. But according to a survey by the Royal Society for Public Health, almost half of people plan to stay away well beyond that, for at least three months. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk That\u2019s why it\u2019s so crucial for pubs that nothing goes seriously wrong this weekend that could imperil their longer-term survival by deterring customers or triggering renewed restrictions. Stosie Madi, who will open the Parkers Arms near Clitheroe in Lancashire from Saturday, says: \u201cI\u2019ve reopened bars in West Africa after coups d\u2019etat but nothing has been as challenging as this pandemic situation. \u201cIt\u2019s a path we\u2019re beating for people opening the following week.

Wearing a face mask in line with coronavirus regulations, Refaeli and her mother, Zipi, entered the Tel Aviv court to a flurry of camera flashes from photographers. The pair confessed to offences of evading taxes on income nearing $10m (\u00a37.9m). Under a plea bargain agreement made last month, Refaeli will serve nine months of community service and her mother will be sent to prison for 16 months. They were also ordered to pay a \u00a31.2m fine on top of millions of back taxes owed to the state. Supermodel Bar Refaeli investigated over tax evasion in Israel Read more Refaeli\u2019s lawyers argued that the plea bargain showed she had not intentionally evaded tax. The long-running trial had gripped the Israeli public, with Refaeli at one point claiming to Israeli tax authorities that she should be exempt from paying dues because she was living in the US with her then boyfriend, Leonardo DiCaprio. She later married the Israeli billionaire Adi Ezra . The 35-year-old model and her mother were investigated for failing to report discounts on luxury goods and other perks that should have been subject to income tax. Despite being ordered to stay in Israel unless given specific approval to leave, Refaeli has maintained her status as a popular TV personality. Last year, she hosted the Eurovision song contest at a glitzy ceremony in Tel Aviv. The model was first propelled to fame when she appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated\u2019s swimwear edition in 2009, a year prosecutors allege she underreported her tax liability. The case mostly revolved around her residency status in the following years, as she toured the world for shoots, taking dozens of flights and spending much of her time outside Israel . Refaeli attempted to prove her \u201ccentre of life\u201d for tax purposes was in the US with DiCaprio and was therefore not liable to some Israeli tax. Prosecutors rejected her claim and charged her with providing incorrect tax information, while judges found her relationship with DiCaprio did not qualify as a \u201cfamily unit\u201d, meaning she should have paid the full taxes. Among the allegations were that Refaeli did not pay rent for her apartment in Tel Aviv despite living there, paid an interior designer for his services by doing publicity for his business, and received a car from a company in return for publicity, none of which were declared. Monday\u2019s indictment said Refaeli\u2019s mother, who was also her agent, had also signed leases for her daughter under the names of other family members to obscure Refaeli\u2019s residency status. Zipi Refaeli was charged with failure to report income, avoiding paying taxes and aiding someone else in evading tax payments.

The 30-year-old met some of his closest friends in a vaping bar, Vape Escape, near the windswept seafront in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset. \u201cI was glad to be seeing people and getting a pint in a pub again,\u201d he says. \u201cWe watched the Man United game and they won \u2013 so I was in a good mood.\u201d As the Saturday evening wore on, the group moved on to another pub in the quiet seaside resort, about a 45-minute drive from Bristol. The six friends moved back and forth between the two pubs before calling it a night. \u201cI was pretty merry,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cBut it was all good.\u201d Yet everything changed when Wilson (not his real name) arrived at his parents\u2019 home in the town just after 1am. He opened an email from NHS Test and Trace, which had arrived at 12:30am. It revealed he had tested positive for coronavirus. Where the pubs are. \u201cIt was a heart-in-mouth moment,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was pure shock. I immediately texted the people I had been with and the next morning I let the pubs know.\u201d Wilson had gone for a test before his return to work in a shop in the town. He had no symptoms and no reason to think he might have come into contact with the virus, but was worried he might catch it serving customers. \u201cI thought: I\u2019ll take a test so I\u2019d know if I got it at work,\u201d he says. News of his positive result reached the co-owner of Vape Escape, Leanne Underhill, first. Underhill, 40, closed the bar straightaway . She made a series of desperate calls to Somerset County Council and the police before finally getting through to NHS Test and Trace. \u201cThey asked me what I had done and took my postcode \u2013 that was it. They didn\u2019t take any other details,\u201d she says, sitting at a table in her recently deep-cleaned bar. \u201cWe were essentially left to deal with it ourselves.\u201d That was her only interaction with the service, which is headed by the former TalkTalk chief executive and Tory peer Dido Harding . \u201cMy perception was that businesses keep all the contact details and then pass them on if there\u2019s an outbreak,\u201d says Underhill. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d Instead, Underhill and another member of staff spent Sunday contacting the 42 people who had been in the bar on Saturday. She even took it upon herself to examine CCTV to identify the people that had close contact with Wilson. \u201cPeople were massively worried. We are a little town \u2013 we don\u2019t expect these kinds of things to happen,\u201d she says. No one advised her what to say to her anxious regulars. Later that evening, Underhill drove three members of staff 23 miles to a testing facility in Taunton. She then carried out a deep clean of the premises, working through the night. \u201cNHS Test and Trace couldn\u2019t even tell me if I needed to test the staff,\u201d she says. All the tests, including hers, came back negative early on Monday. The other pub visited by Wilson\u2019s group, the Lighthouse, is yet to reopen. The landlady, Jess Green, closed on Monday and, like Underhill, contacted 90 people who had visited on Saturday herself. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to phone anyone \u2013 it should have been Test and Trace,\u201d she says, sitting in the empty bar with its one-way system still taped to the floor. \u201cWe chose to do it off our own backs because we knew it was the quickest way for our customers to know the truth.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest Leanne Underhill co-owner of Vape Escape. \u2018People were massively worried.\u2019 Photograph: Tom Wall/The Observer However, wild, unfounded rumours were starting to spread around the town, fuelled by fear and anger on social media. Some claimed Wilson had known he was infected before heading out or that he worked in a care home. Others swore he had visited every pub in the town. His identity became an open secret, discussed in cafes, shops and street corners. Comments branding him \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d, \u201cignorant and selfish\u201d and calling for him \u201cto be jailed for not listening\u201d appeared on the social media pages of the two pubs. Wilson, who suffers from anxiety, came off Facebook to escape what he felt was a torrent of abuse. \u201cI couldn\u2019t handle seeing it,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople were posting that I already knew I had it and stuff like that. But I would never go out knowing I had it \u2013 or even if I thought I might have it.\u201d Avon and Somerset police even had to speak to one person who sent a social media message that was \u201cthreatening in nature\u201d. \u201cSomeone posted \u2018I can\u2019t wait to see him\u2019 on Facebook,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cThe police went around and spoke to him. He apologised and said he had lost a family member to coronavirus and had been drinking.\u201d In the midst of all this, Wilson spoke to NHS Test and Trace for just over an hour, detailing his movements over the last couple of weeks. \u201cI ran through everything I could remember with them,\u201d he says. The service then got in touch with his close contacts and asked them to self-isolate. Underhill and her family were also hounded, with some in the town furious that she had reopened the bar on Monday. She claims her 18-year-old daughter fled from a supermarket in the town after other shoppers yelled that she was \u201cinfected\u201d and should be in isolation. It got so bad that Underhill resigned from her other job as an HR manager for a manufacturing company on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m having to shield my staff from abuse and look after my family. There\u2019s no way at the moment I can do all of that while working full time,\u201d she says. These reactions worry Somerset\u2019s director of public health, Trudi Grant. She says people should not be discouraged from coming forward for testing. \u201cIt is really concerning,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want people to feel as though they can get a test and notify the right people at the right time. If they feel as though they can\u2019t do that, then that isn\u2019t going to be helpful to us in managing the local epidemic or the national pandemic.\u201d He\u2019s become public enemy number one. But he didn\u2019t go out deliberately with the virus Andrew Lowe, pubgoer Grant says that Wilson and the two pubs actually deserve thanks. \u201cHe acted responsibly as an individual,\u201d she says. \u201cThe businesses took a very precautionary approach. They did their bit.\u201d She adds that business owners should not need to contact customers if they get a positive case. Her team will be circulating further information to local businesses in the coming weeks. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to phone around,\u201d she says. \u201cThey should call Public Health England, who will identify with them who is a close contact.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe would like to reassure the public that anyone identified as a close contact of the positive case will be contacted by the NHS Test and Trace service and advised to self-isolate for 14 days, even if they aren\u2019t displaying symptoms. The pub has been advised to take appropriate public health measures to ensure it is safe for other staff and customers to attend as normal.\u201d Back in Burnham-on-Sea, feelings are still running high. One woman in the Somerset & Dorset pub, who declined to give her name, said: \u201cApparently he went out knowing he should have waited at home until he got the results.\u201d (In fact, NHS advice is to self-isolate if you have received a positive test result or have symptoms of coronavirus, or if either of those things is true of someone in your household or support bubble.) Other drinkers in the town centre pub \u2013 which itself had to close on Thursday night after another individual tested positive \u2013 are quick to defend Wilson. \u201cHe\u2019s become public enemy number one,\u201d says Andrew Lowe, 47. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t go out deliberately with the virus. He didn\u2019t know he had it and as soon as he did know he notified all the pubs he visited. He did the right thing.\u201d Wilson is recovering from the ordeal with the support of his family and friends. Yet he fears his treatment could make others in his position think twice about coming forward: \u201cIf anyone else in Burnham gets the virus now they\u2019re not going to want to make it public because they could get the same kind of abuse.\u201d Topics Coronavirus outbreak The Observer Infectious diseases Pubs NHS features Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story \u2018A slap in the face\u2019: pub landlords livid at lack of support by Sunak Publicans fear for future as chancellor\u2019s proposals offer nothing for traditional locals Published: 11 Jul 2020 \u2018A slap in the face\u2019: pub landlords livid at lack of support by Sunak Welsh restaurants and pubs could reopen indoors from August Beauty salons and museums to reopen from 27 July and some amateur team sport to resume Published: 10 Jul 2020 Welsh restaurants and pubs could reopen indoors from August Pubs and restaurants in England trade at half their pre-virus levels Trade in line with expectations, with restaurants less likely than pubs to open their doors Published: 10 Jul 2020 Pubs and restaurants in England trade at half their pre-virus levels Pubs warn of closure risk after alcohol VAT cut exemption Firms \u2018heartbroken\u2019 as alcohol sales are excluded from tax relief in summer statement Published: 8 Jul 2020 Pubs warn of closure risk after alcohol VAT cut exemption Fears of widespread disorder unfounded as English pubs reopen Published: 5 Jul 2020 Fears of widespread disorder unfounded as English pubs reopen Unlocked and uncertain, the brave head out for a pint and a haircut Published: 5 Jul 2020 Unlocked and uncertain, the brave head out for a pint and a haircut Pub opens for England's lockdown easing despite being hit by car Published: 4 Jul 2020 Pub opens for England's lockdown easing despite being hit by car Pub reopening in England puts publicans in a froth Published: 3 Jul 2020 Pub reopening in England puts publicans in a froth More more on this story Most popular World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Ei Group \u2013 formerly known as Enterprise Inns and which owns a portfolio of more than 4,000 pubs \u2013 has told its managers that Covid-19 is not included in the group\u2019s policy with the insurer Zurich and has advised them to consider seeking further cover elsewhere. Industry sources indicated that it appears likely the problem could be replicated in other sectors. UK supermarkets appeal for calm as shelves empty Read more In a letter sent to publicans last week, which has been seen by the Guardian, Ei said: \u201cIt has been confirmed that Zurich is not including Covid-19 in its notifiable diseases section. As such, any business affected by Covid-19 will not be able to claim for loss of trade.\u201d The move comes after many small-business owners had thought a problem with making insurance claims for coronavirus losses had been solved. Earlier this month, the government bowed to pressure by changing its stance on insurance to declare coronavirus as a \u201cnotifiable disease\u201d \u2013 a formal classification required by many insurance policies. However, many of these existing policies cite specific diseases that businesses can claim for. As coronavirus is so new, it is not included in most of the lists. A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said : \u201cA small number of businesses may have cover in place that will specifically provide for business interruption arising from notifiable diseases. However, this type of extension is not commonly included as standard. Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks and are therefore unlikely to provide cover for the effects of global pandemics like Covid-19.\u201d Viv English, who runs the Lansdown Arms in Lewes, Sussex, said: \u201cWe have no Premier League games and maybe a 20% to 30% hit on trade. I have been paying into the policy for almost 20 years, it is compulsory for us to have it [as an Ei tenant] and it is going to let us down just when we need it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a real hit and I already know I can\u2019t pay my VAT bill. We are now paying VAT [due from] December when it was Christmas and everything was fab. We are now thinking if it is better to close down for a few months and pick up then?\u201d Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk Last week, Rishi Sunak unveiled a range of moves in his first budget that were designed to assist pubs and other small businesses where trade is likely to be hit by the virus. The chancellor said he was also making big changes to the business rates paid by pubs this year, in an effort to insulate them from the economic effects of the coronavirus . Leisure businesses with a rateable value of less than \u00a351,000 will pay no rates for the next 12 months, while the \u201cpub discount\u201d given to bars with a rateable value of up to \u00a3100,000 will increase from \u00a31,000 to \u00a35,000 this year. A spokesman for Zurich said: \u201cZurich\u2019s cover for business interruption is fully aligned with the rest of the insurance market.

This week, the strict rules on distancing which require people to stay 2 metres apart when they are out and about or at work are expected to be changed , in a move which will be welcomed by the hospitality industry. Many pubs and restaurants were forced to shut down completely in March, and have been struggling to work out how to accommodate customers when they are allowed to reopen from 4 July. Shepherd is amongst the many business owners who are planning to reopen when the lockdown restrictions on pubs and restaurants are relaxed, and said any changes to physical distancing rules will make a huge difference to his income. While the pub is lucky enough to have a garden and car park to fill, the real difficulty will be indoor seating, he said, especially if the weather turns bad. With the 2-metre rule in place, Shepherd expects to be able to fit just eight to 12 patrons inside. That figure jumps to 60 if the distance is cut in half. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to do all sorts of things in terms of gazebos and where we can put up shelters or whatever, but a change to a 1-metre rule definitely makes the pub a more viable operation in the short term,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cIt goes from being a hobby that we cling to to being a viable business.\u201d Ben Squire runs passenger ferries and a cafe in Plymouth and was just about to open a seafood restaurant, the Hook & Line, when lockdown started. Instead of a grand opening, he started offering takeaways a few weeks ago. He said a change in the rules would be \u201cmake or break\u201d for businesses like his. \u201cWe can have about 80 customers without social distancing, so at 2 metres we were looking at about 20. The margins are tight anyway.\u201d Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Squire, left, was about to open the Hook & Line restaurant in Plymouth when lockdown began. He added: \u201cIf it does go to 1 metre, there\u2019s a little bit of life in that, we are in with a good chance, so I am hoping that happens.\u201d Stephen Turvil, who owns the Herne Tavern in East Dulwich, London, said the change from a 2-metre rule to 1-metre distancing would make \u201ca huge difference \u2013 that will return us almost to normal capacity\u201d. His pub also has a large garden. \u201cIf the 2-metre rule stays, we\u2019ll have to get rid of half of the tables in the garden, but if it\u2019s 1 metre we will be OK.\u201d The pub has been closed during lockdown, and he has taken the opportunity to get the floors redecorated. \u201cAll of the table and chairs are currently stacked up and I am reluctant to put them back out until we have clear guidelines,\u201d he said. The pub is set to reopen on 4 July, and will operate table service with staff taking orders and bringing drinks from the bar, and a limited food menu. In the men\u2019s toilets, the middle urinal will be taped off. Changes to physical distancing rules won\u2019t make any difference to those plans, he says. Turvil says he has still not had any clear communication about the rules. And he has concerns about the day that has been chosen for reopening. \u201cI would much rather it wasn\u2019t a Saturday \u2013 I think there will be teething problems, so I think they should put it back, maybe to the Wednesday afterwards. We could wait and reopen later, but I worry that would give our competitors an advantage.\u201d Topics Coronavirus outbreak Pubs Restaurants Travel & leisure Food & drink industry news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most popular World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

That number need not have been so high. At the time of writing, the numbers are 351,000 and 15,000 respectively . Our research did not use any complicated model with a vast number of variables, no more than someone watching an avalanche heading in their direction calls for complicated statistical models to see if they need to get out of the way. We called for a simple exercise of the precautionary principle in a domain where it mattered: interconnected complex systems have some attributes that allow some things to cascade out of control, delivering extreme outcomes. Enact robust measures that would have been, at the time, of small cost: constrain mobility . Immediately. Later, we invoked a rapid investment in preparedness: tests, hospital capacity, means to treat patients. Just in case, you know. Things can happen. The error in the UK is on two levels. Modelling and policymaking. First, at the modelling level, the government relied at all stages on epidemiological models that were designed to show us roughly what happens when a preselected set of actions are made, and not what we should make happen, and how. The modellers use hypotheses/assumptions, which they then feed into models, and use to draw conclusions and make policy recommendations. Critically, they do not produce an error rate. What if these assumptions are wrong? Have they been tested? The answer is often no. For academic papers, this is fine. Flawed theories can provoke discussion. Risk management \u2013 like wisdom \u2013 requires robustness in models. But if we base our pandemic response plans on flawed academic models, people die. And they will. This was the case with the disastrous \u201c herd immunity \u201d thesis. The idea behind herd immunity was that the outbreak would stop if enough people got sick and gained immunity. Once a critical mass of young people gained immunity, so the epidemiological modellers told us, vulnerable populations (old and sick people) would be protected. Of course, this idea was nothing more than a dressed-up version of the \u201cjust do nothing\u201d approach. Individuals and scientists around the world immediately pointed out the obvious flaws : there\u2019s no way to ensure only young people get infected; you need 60-70% of the population to be infected and recover to have a shot at herd immunity, and there aren\u2019t that many young and healthy people in the UK, or anywhere. Moreover, many young people have severe cases of the disease, overloading healthcare systems, and a not-so-small number of them die. It is not a free ride. This doesn\u2019t even include the possibility, already suspected in some cases, of re ccurrence of the disease . Immunity may not even be reliable for this virus. Worse, it did not take into account that the duration of hospitalisation can be lengthier than they think, or that one can incur a shortage of hospital beds . Second, but more grave, is the policymaking. No 10 appears to be enamoured with \u201cscientism\u201d \u2013 things that have the cosmetic attributes of science but without its rigour. This manifests itself in the nudge group that engages in experimenting with UK citizens or applying methods from behavioural economics that fail to work outside the university \u2013 yet patronise citizens as an insult to their ancestral wisdom and risk-perception apparatus. Social science is in a \u201creplication crisis\u201d, where less than half the results replicate (under exact same conditions), less than a tenth can be taken seriously, and less than a hundredth translate into the real world. So what is called \u201cevidence-based\u201d methods have a dire track record and are pretty much evidence-free. This scientism also manifests itself in Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings\u2019s love of complexity and complex systems (our speciality) which he appears to apply incorrectly. And letting a segment of the population die for the sake of the economy is a false dichotomy \u2013 aside from the moral repugnance of the idea. As we said, when one deals with deep uncertainty, both governance and precaution require us to hedge for the worst. While risk-taking is a business that is left to individuals, collective safety and systemic risk are the business of the state. Failing that mandate of prudence by gambling with the lives of citizens is a professional wrongdoing that extends beyond academic mistake; it is a violation of the ethics of governing. The obvious policy left now is a lockdown, with overactive testing and contact tracing: follow the evidence from China and South Korea rather than thousands of error-prone computer codes. So we have wasted weeks, and ones that matter with a multiplicative threat. \u2022 Nassim Nicholas Taleb is distinguished professor of risk engineering at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and author of The Black Swan.

The 1,700-strong pub chain says it has spent \u00a315m on preparing venues to reopen, which could happen as soon as 4 July in England. The rival chain JD Wetherspoon has already laid out its blueprint for how pubs will look in a world shaped by the pandemic , with protective screens between tables and staff wearing goggles and masks. Greene King will deploy some of the same plans but unveiled some new measures it hopes will make pubs safe enough to avoid coronavirus transmission, without ruining the atmosphere. It said toilets would be cleaned every 15 minutes and customers would be allowed in only one at a time. Upon entering and leaving the toilet, they would be asked to flip an indicator between red and green, so that other patrons knew whether someone was inside.

Photograph: Greene King Customers are being advised to pre-book a table rather than stand at the bar, while perspex screens will be erected to create barriers between tables and between drinkers and bar staff. A \u201cpub host\u201d will welcome people at the entrance and show them to tables, and keep physically distanced queues in order, while signage will be used to direct people to routes around the pub that minimise contact. Like Wetherspoons, the company is urging customers to pay using its app and to use hand sanitiser stations positioned around the pub. Each pub will provide one-time-use menus customers can take away or dispose of, while cutlery will be wrapped and condiments in sachets or in fresh ramekins. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A green light system has been introduced at Greene King\u2019s toilets. Photograph: Greene King A designated \u201cpub safe monitor\u201d, wearing a special uniform, will be tasked with ensuring compliance and dealing with any safety concerns raised by pub-goers. Greene King\u2019s chief executive, Nick Mackenzie, said: \u201cOf course, customers will notice some differences when they return but it\u2019s important that alongside implementing the changes, we maintain the very essence of the great British pub. \u201cMany pubs across the country, including a number of our own, will not be financially viable or able to open for operational reasons with the current restrictions in place and we hope that, for the future of our industry, these measures will be short-lived. \u201cWe are working towards a phased reopening and are planning to open as many as we can.\u201d Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk The pub industry has called for clarity on when it can reopen after the government hinted that drinks could be served in beer gardens from 22 June, only to abandon the plan and say that pubs would not open before 4 July. The industry\u2019s trade body, the British Beer and Pub Association has warned that many pubs would have to remain shut unless physical distancing requirements were reduced from 2 metres to one. Mackenzie echoed the call, saying a reduction \u201cwould make it possible for many more pubs across the country to be viable\u201d.

Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters Most European governments are making decisions on how far and quickly to exclude Huawei from 5G networks. Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor Published on Mon 13 Jul 2020 14.52 BST Robert O\u2019Brien, the US national security adviser, will meet his counterparts from France, Italy, the UK and Germany in Paris this week to urge European nations to debar the Chinese technology company Huawei from Europe\u2019s 5G networks. The meetings, over three days, underline how most European governments are facing similar choices to the UK, which will announce on Tuesday its decision on the company, on how far and quickly to exclude Huawei, and with what consequences in terms of potential Chinese reprisals. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, last month claimed there had been a transatlantic awakening to the threat posed by China. \u201cHuawei\u2019s deals with telecommunications operators around the world are evaporating, because countries are only allowing trusted vendors in their 5G networks\u201d, he said. France has said it will not ban Huawei equipment outright from the country\u2019s 5G network but is encouraging operators not to use it and granting only temporary authorisations of up to eight years to those companies that already do \u2013 SFR and Bouygues Telecom. \u201cWhat I can say is that there won\u2019t be a total ban,\u201d Guillaume Poupard, the head of the French cybersecurity agency ANSSI, said last week. \u201cBut for operators that are not currently using Huawei, we are them not to go for it.\u201d Poupard said the decision was \u201cnot Huawei-bashing, or anti-Chinese racism. All we\u2019re saying is that the risk is not the same with European suppliers as with non-Europeans.\u201d The finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has said Paris is aiming to keep the Chinese manufacturer out of the country\u2019s core mobile network, which processes sensitive information such as customers\u2019 personal data. The state-controlled network Orange has already chosen Huawei\u2019s European rivals Nokia and Ericsson. In Germany the government is still divided over Huawei, with some members wanting to exclude it altogether for 5G. Parliament is now in recess, so no decision on what IT security rules Huawei would have to follow in Germany is likely until after the break. In February, Angela Merkel resisted pressure for her party, the CDU, to adopt a policy of removing Huawei from the new network, but the Greens and some in her own party, such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee, Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, are saying Germany has to realise the security risk. In Spain the national intelligence service certified the software as safe and compliant with the relative legislation last month. Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s existing 4G technology in Spain depends entirely on Huawei equipment so Telef\u00f3nica will continue to have Huawei technology in what is known as its 5G core \u2013 where the most sensitive information is stored \u2013 for now and in its so-called periphery, which consists of masts, antennas and passive equipment. In central and eastern Europe, the US has had some success at pushing for a tough line in countries strongly reliant on Nato military protection. Romania , Poland , the Czech Republic , Latvia and Estonia have all signed joint statements with Washington on 5G security, pledging that the countries will not allow access to their markets to companies subject to foreign state interference. Last year, Poland arrested a Huawei employee in Warsaw on spying charges, and called for the EU and Nato to develop a joint stance on Huawei. In Hungary , where the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has built friendly relations with China, the government said last November that it had not seen any evidence that Huawei equipment would pose a security threat, and has said it will include the company in its 5G rollout. Tele2, a major telecommunication company in Sweden , is building its 5G network with Huawei equipment. \u201cWe have used Huawei\u2019s equipment since 4G and there have been no security problems,\u201d said Anders Ygeman, the minister for digital development. But TDC, the largest operator in Denmark , earlier this year chose Sweden\u2019s Ericsson to build its 5G network after the Danish energy minister, Lars Christian Lilleholt, underlined 5G security concerns without specifically mentioning Huawei. Two big companies, Vodafone and Eir, are using Huawei technology as they build the 5G network in Ireland . The Trump administration has lobbied Ireland as many US tech companies have operations there and so, in theory, are vulnerable. The Irish government is trying not to say anything publicly but seems content to let Vodafone and Eir plough ahead with Huawei. The European commission has issued guidance \u2013 it has no direct powers \u2013 suggesting EU member states avoid \u201chigh-risk\u201d suppliers and called on governments to take a common approach.

Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters Investors are increasingly concerned about sustainability. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters Animals farmed is supported by About this content Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro Published on Tue 28 Jul 2020 07.30 BST The investment arm of northern Europe\u2019s largest financial services group has dropped JBS, the world\u2019s biggest meat processer , from its portfolio. The Brazilian company is now excluded from assets sold by Nordea Asset Management, which controls a \u20ac230bn (\u00a3210bn) fund, according to Eric Pedersen, its head of responsible investments. The decision was taken about a month ago, over the meat giant\u2019s links to farms involved in Amazon deforestation, its response to the Covid-19 outbreak, past corruption scandals , and frustrations over engagement with the company on such issues. \u201cThe exclusion of JBS is quite dramatic for us because it is from all of our funds, not just the ones labelled ESG,\u201d Pedersen said. ESG stands for the \u201c environmental, social and governmental \u201d standards used to evaluate a company\u2019s sustainability and societal impact for investors. A third of Nordea Asset Management\u2019s investments are classified as ESG, Pedersen said. Nordea was one of 29 international financial institutions managing $3.7tn (\u00a32.9tn) worth of funds that warned the Brazilian government last month over rising deforestation. Last year, Nordea suspended the purchase of Brazilian government bonds after the Amazon fires crisis. Over the past year alone, five expos\u00e9s by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the Brazilian agency R\u00e9porter Brasil, Greenpeace and Amnesty International, have linked JBS to cattle supplied by Amazon farms involved in deforestation. Although the company has made advances in controlling its \u201cdirect suppliers\u201d \u2013 the farms from which its slaughterhouses source cattle \u2013 it is unable to control its \u201cindirect suppliers\u201d. These are farms breeding or rearing cattle that sell on to farms that in turn supply JBS slaughterhouses. In some cases, the \u201cclean farms\u201d have links to \u201cdirty farms\u201d \u2013 or are even run by the same people, as in the latest case revealed on Monday. JBS and Brazil\u2019s other large-scale meat producers Minerva and Marfrig have been subject to controversy over their Amazon cattle sourcing for more than a decade. In 2009, after a devastating Greenpeace report , JBS, Marfrig, Minerva and other companies committed to stop buying from any direct suppliers involved in deforestation. Within two years, they promised to verify that their indirect suppliers were not involved in deforestation, either \u2013 but that promise has yet to be fulfilled. That same year JBS, Minerva and Marfrig signed similar deals with federal prosecutors . In 2017, JBS was fined $7.7m by government environment agency Ibama for buying over 49,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas in the Amazon state of Par\u00e1 \u2013 some from indirect suppliers. As a result, Greenpeace walked out of the deal, but the agreement with federal prosecutors still stands. In July 2019, an investigation published by the Guardian, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and R\u00e9porter Brasil found that JBS slaughterhouses in the same state had bought cattle from farms owned by AgroSB Agropecu\u00e1ria SA, a powerful ranching company. Those farms had been supplied with cattle from another ranch owned by the same company \u2013 a ranch with a long history of fines and land embargoes for deforestation. AgroSB said the deforestation had occurred before it bought the land in 2008. JBS said it did not buy cattle from land that had been illegally deforested or embargoed against use for ranching and that its own 2018 independent audit showed that more than 99.9% of its purchases met the terms of the Greenpeace deal. It did not say that its independent audit recognised the company was unable to audit its indirect suppliers. And earlier this year a R\u00e9porter Brasil investigation published by the Guardian linked the company to a farmer whose farm, according to satellite images, had seen extensive deforestation in 2015. A sawmill the farmer had owned in another location also had a long list of fines. A court recently dropped charges against him in another case involving the massacre of nine men. Meat companies in Brazil say they are working to improve transparency in their supply chains. Photograph: Joedson Alves/EPA JBS reiterated its previous position that it did not buy cattle from farms involved in deforestation, invasion of indigenous reserves, rural conflicts or land conflicts, and denied the farmer had ever been a supplier. The company said it monitored more than 50,000 potential cattle-supplying farms every day and had blocked more than 8,000 due to non-compliance. It told the Guardian: \u201cFull traceability of our supply chain including workable solutions to monitor indirect supply remains a top priority. New initiatives have been proposed and are being examined with stakeholders on top of the substantial policies that have already been implemented.\u201d On 1 July it introduced a new \u201ctheoretical index\u201d that uses a farm\u2019s productivity to calculate if it is suspected of cattle laundering and now checks supplier farms for Ibama embargoes. It has also said it is working on a \u201cgreen\u201d version of cattle movement records with Brazil\u2019s agriculture ministry that would show the environmental status of supplying farms. The company has said it has been discussing the scheme with the ministry since 2014. Marfrig repeated its previous statements and said it was \u201cfully aware of the challenges related to the livestock production chain\u201d, highlighting its mechanism under which farmers supply information on their suppliers. It said 53% of its Amazon cattle came from indirect suppliers. Minerva said its Amazon cattle purchases were \u201c100% made in monitored farms\u201d but that it was not possible to fully track Amazon cattle movements without full access to government data, which it does not have. In June this year a Greenpeace investigation reported by the Guardian found JBS, Marfrig and Minerva had bought cattle from a farm that sourced cattle from another farm inside a protected reserve in Mato Grosso state co-owned by the same owner \u2013 who had been charged with environmental crimes. According to a 2017 Observer report , JBS had said it had blocked purchases from farms inside the reserve. This month, Amnesty International, with R\u00e9porter Brasil, revealed that cattle illegally grazed in protected areas of the Amazon state of Rond\u00f4nia had entered the JBS supply chain. JBS says the company \u201cis fully committed to achieving a deforestation-free beef supply chain and avoiding irregular suppliers. We acknowledge that indirect supplier traceability remains a system level issue in Brazil and are working with governmental and cross-industry stakeholders to find workable solutions. We urge anyone with evidence of malpractice to report it to the appropriate authorities. We also operate a company whistleblowing hotline for any employee to contact if they see or suspect irregularities.\u201d But Pedersen said scandals such as these, and JBS\u2019s response to them, influenced Nordea\u2019s decision to exclude the company from its portfolio. \u201cWe\u2019ve had several meetings with them in Brazil and regular updates by phone and video and we\u2019ve not been impressed with the level of commitment we could see from their side,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see progress, we have to take that step.\u201d Sustainability is increasingly important not just for ESG investments, Pedersen said, but for standard products, too. \u201cWe are also engaging with Minerva and of course Marfrig,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bar keeps rising.\u201d JBS told the Guardian that it does not comment on dialogue with its shareholders. On 23 July, Marfrig launched its own ambitious plan to monitor all indirect suppliers in the Amazon by 2025 and Brazil\u2019s Cerrado savanna region by 2030, using chips in cattle, satellite monitoring, blockchain and risk maps, as well as schemes to help farmers previously involved in deforestation produce sustainably. \u201cThe details are lacking of when it will start, what is the target per year, what system will be used,\u201d said Daniel Azeredo, the federal prosecutor involved in the 2009 deals with the meat companies, but he stressed: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive plan.\u201d Adriana Charoux, Greenpeace Brazil\u2019s senior forest campaigner, said the company\u2019s deadlines were too long. \u201cMarfrig knew the roots of this problem in 2009,\u201d she said. Minerva said that in July it began testing Visipec , a cloud-based, tracing tool developed by the University of Wisconsin and the US National Wildlife Federation. It said it monitors over 9,000 suppliers in the Amazon, but said \u201ccurrently there are no data and accessible statistics \u2026 to determine the number of indirect suppliers in Brazil.\u201d Topics Deforestation Animals farmed Brazil Meat Meat industry Americas Farming Food (global) news Reuse this content World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The action concerns alleged use of so-called \"defeat devices\" to mask vehicles' diesel pollution output. Engines used by Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep, as well as CNH's Iveco trucks are the focus of the probe. UK authorities have also asked two firms in London to provide documents. Fiat-Chrysler Automobile (FCA) and CNH Industrial (CNH) are both controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family. Lawsuit alleges defeat devices in Nissan petrol cars Volkswagen loses landmark German 'dieselgate' case A statement from Eurojust, a European Union agency for criminal cooperation across member states, said the probe is looking into a \"number of people\" who may have been involved in allegedly allowing use of the devices. It did not name them. The raids, initiated by German prosecutors investigating emissions fraud, involve claims that defeat devices were used in engine management software in 200,000 vehicles. Use of software to flatter emissions levels hit the headlines over the Volkswagen \"diselegate\" affair. Defeat devices allow engines to meet pollution levels under laboratory tests, but shut down the emissions control system in real-world driving conditions. UK documents Eurojust did not name the companies raided. However, FCA and CNH issued similar statements, acknowledging that investigators had turned up at several offices in Europe, and that they are cooperating fully with authorities. Eurojust also said that \"UK authorities have ordered two companies in London to produce relevant documents\". Again, these companies were not named. The statement said: \"Defeat devices are illegal according to the European Union regulations in place. Vehicles with defeat devices are not approved for road usage in the EU and consumers with such devices installed in their cars face possible driving bans.\" Wednesday's raids were at three offices in Germany, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse, three locations in the Piedmont region of Italy, and one location in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. The VW dieselgate scandal broke in 2015, since when Europe's biggest carmaker has paid out \u20ac30bn (\u00a327bn) in fines and been investigated by regulators across the world. In the UK, motorists are involved in legal action for compensation . But VW is far from the only manufacture caught in claims about defeat devices.

The Italian-American maker of Fiats, Alfa Romeos, Jeeps and Rams said on Friday it slashed advertising costs and saw net prices rise in its key North American market, where it focused on retail sales over lower-margin fleet business. It also cut capital expenditure across the group, and expects to reduce the total for the full year by 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to 8-8.5 billion euros. FCA <FCHA.MI> posted an adjusted loss before interest and tax of 928 million euros for April-June, versus a forecast 1.87 billion euro loss in an analyst poll compiled by Reuters. Earlier in the week, Ford Motor <F.N> reported a second-quarter operating loss of $1.9 billion. General Motors <GM.N> had an operating loss of $1.2 billion. In North America, FCA <FCAU.N> made adjusted earnings before interest and tax of 39 million euros. CEO Mike Manley said production in North America was back to pre-pandemic levels, apart from plants in Warren, Michigan and Toluca, Mexico, which are being retooled for new products. \"We expect a much, much better second half,\" he told investors on a conference call. Milan-listed FCA shares were up 1.5% at 1310 GMT, having been little changed before the results. Manley said the group planned to launch a series of new Jeep models next year, including a new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, and a redesigned Grand Cherokee. Asked about electric pickup trucks coming from its competitors, Manley said FCA was \"very committed\" to electrifying its vehicles, adding: \"Pickup trucks is a key franchise for us. We're not going to sit on the sidelines.\" FCA, which is set to tie-up with Peugeot maker PSA <PEUP.PA> to create Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker, said an ongoing probe by European Commission competition authorities was not expected to delay the merger timetable. Despite the pandemic, PSA earlier this week delivered a profit in the first half of the year. FCA said its industrial free cash flow was minus 4.9 billion euros in the second quarter, with a slightly lower cash burn versus January-March. It finished the quarter with liquidity of 17.5 billion euros. That does not include 4.5 billion euros still available on its loan facility. Ford had liquidity of $40 billion, and GM $31 billion.

Will coronavirus trigger a global recession? | Jeffrey Frankel Read more The cutbacks came as several other European companies warned that the outbreak was hurting their operations or introduced emergency measures to protect staff. Sky said its offices would bar visitors who had been in high-risk countries in order to reduce the threat of contagion for its staff, with all guests required to complete a form at reception desks. The Italian manufacturer MTA, which makes electrical parts for cars, has been forced to close its factory in Codogno after the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy. It said the closure would have a knock-on effect on production at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s plants in the country before spreading to other carmakers across Europe. The closure of the plant in the Lombardy region would immediately force Fiat to shut production lines at four plants as soon as Wednesday, MTA said. Continued closure would mean all the other Fiat plants in Europe and those of Renault, BMW and Peugeot would close from 2 March. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK\u2019s largest carmaker, and the lorry makers Iveco and CNH, would be affected if the shutdown lasted longer. Diageo, the UK-based owner of Guinness and the world\u2019s biggest whisky producer with brands such as Johnnie Walker, said Covid-19 could hit its profits by up to \u00a3200m as restaurants and bars in China stay shut. Q&A How can I protect myself and others from the coronavirus outbreak? Show Hide The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days . If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days , to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. SSP Group, the British operator of restaurants and bars in airports and railway stations, said its sales across the Asia Pacific region would slump by half in February. FTSE 100 tumbles below 7,000 points as Diageo warns of \u00a3200m coronavirus hit - business live Read more Diageo predicted a decline in profits of \u00a3140m-\u00a3200m in the year to the end of June. Sales are expected to be down by up to \u00a3325m. Its estimates excluded the impact of the coronavirus on other markets beyond Greater China and Asia Pacific. Diageo said the majority of consumption of its products in China took place in bars and restaurants, which mostly remain closed. \u201cWe have seen significant disruption since the end of January, which we expect to last at least into March,\u201d it said. \u201cThereafter we expect a gradual improvement, with consumption returning to normal levels towards [June].\u201d The company also highlighted the impact in South Korea, Japan and Thailand, where events have been postponed, conferences and banquets have been cancelled and a drop in tourism has also had an impact on consumption in bars and restaurants. The significant drop in international air travel, especially across Asia Pacific, has also hurt Diageo\u2019s business, including sales in airports. Danone, the maker of products including Volvic and Evian bottled water, and Activia yoghurts, said it would take a \u20ac100m (\u00a384m) sales hit in the first quarter as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. The French-based company was experiencing a \u201csevere demand slowdown\u201d for its Mizone water brand in China, which is Danone\u2019s second biggest market and accounted for 10% of global sales last year. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Danone employs 8,200 staff in China and has eight factories, seven of which support its water business. The company said water production resumed on 17 February except for at its factory in Wuhan, which is at the centre of the outbreak. SSP said in the Asia Pacific region, which generates 8% of group revenues, domestic and international air travel relating to China was down 90%, Hong Kong was down 70% and Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines were down 25% to 30%. Its share price fell almost 4% on Wednesday morning and the company said group revenue would be down by \u00a310m-\u00a312m in February, with operating profits down \u00a34m-\u00a35m.

Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images \u2018President Trump\u2019s description of the US Federal Reserve as the \u2018enemy\u2019 is designed to rob it of the very democratic legitimacy it cannot live without.\u2019 The Fed and US flags in Washington DC. Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images Published on Thu 18 Jun 2020 11.22 BST I n the past few months, the world\u2019s central banks, above all the US Federal Reserve, have rescued the global economy from complete collapse for the second time in a generation. Wading unto the breach and armed with the knowledge of how close capitalism came to a system failure in 2008, they have fired the \u201cbig bazookas\u201d of monetary policy, pumping trillions of dollars into the world\u2019s giant pool of money, effectively creating wealth out of nothing. Since 2 March, the Fed\u2019s total assets have leapt by more than half . Since 2008, its balance sheet has grown to 30% of the size of the US economy. Central bankers seem confident their actions will find public approval. \u201cA firefighter has never been criticised for using too much water,\u201d the governor of the Bank of Canada said . This confidence is misplaced. Both left and right have reason to welcome the Fed\u2019s emergency intervention, but new money flooded into private capital markets will inevitably flow into the deepest pockets. And without strengthening the democratic legitimacy of this policy, and using it for socially transformative ends, the reaction will strengthen those who are antagonistic to the practice of government \u2013 the populist right. The stock market\u2019s worst fears seem to have been allayed by congressional action and the Fed\u2019s promised bond-buying spree In his recent book , the French economist Thomas Piketty observes that central banks have become the only effectively functioning organs of government. He doesn\u2019t mean this as a good thing. \u201cMonetary activism\u201d is financial triage against world economic collapse, but it\u2019s also an avoidance tactic. It works by bracketing democracy and letting the technocrats take over. To make decisions about justice and distribution, discussions about taxation, policy and budgets are needed. As the Fed chairman Jerome Powell put it, the central bank has the power to lend but not to tax and spend. It is up to elected officials to \u201cmake decisions about where we as a society should direct our collective resources\u201d. In the last two months, he has all but begged Congress to be more proactive in shaping the direction and volume of the policy. Progressives have reason to praise central banks for offering evidence that the \u201cmoney printer can go brrr\u201d without any clear limit. Economists see no sign of inflation on the horizon. Some have become concerned about inflation in recent weeks, but others worry about the opposite \u2013 deflation. All the extra liquidity has not managed to translate into meaningful growth. This makes an active role for the state in hiring people in sustainable jobs \u2013 in green energy, construction, arts, healthcare, education \u2013 all the more important. Public spending of the New Deal helped cure the Great Depression in the 1930s, so why not a Green New Deal for this one? Central bankers have emerged as unlikely allies in the fight against climate change. Maybe this latest intervention could finally open them up to the idea of \u201cGreen QE\u201d, (quantitative easing) actively supporting decarbonisation by buying up environmentally friendly bonds. Republicans, for their part, are relieved that the Fed rescued the economy from meltdown, giving Donald Trump at least a chance of campaigning amid a recovery. Though unemployment is stratospheric and hundreds of Americans are still dying of Covid-19, the stock market\u2019s worst fears seem to have been allayed by congressional action and the Fed\u2019s promised bond-buying spree. But neither side should feel secure under the sheltering hand of unelected power like the central bank. The politics of money has a way of quickly becoming about other things. Last month, the German constitutional court concluded in a shock ruling that the European Central Bank may have exceeded its mandate in creating so much cheap credit, threatening the monetary response to the crisis. Within days, Viktor Orb\u00e1n suggested that the Hungarian constitution might trump the decisions of the European Court of Justice in his country\u2019s treatment of refugees. What kind of political creatures could the money-printing of central banks spawn? We have seen hints in the past. A decade ago, the proactive Fed was a target for the Tea Party movement. Republicans directed the backlash to control of the House in 2010 and eventually over Congress. Opposing President Barack Obama, the Republican party acted as a drag on recovery efforts and robust healthcare reform. The US is paying the price for their efforts with a dysfunctional healthcare system in a pandemic in which the victims have been disproportionately African American. There are reasons to think the response to the Fed\u2019s actions from the right might be more extreme this time, not only because the scale of both spending and suffering is greater, but also because the fringe itself has become radicalised. Central banks have no shortage of enemies in waiting. President Trump\u2019s description of the Fed as the \u201c enemy \u201d is designed to rob it of the very democratic legitimacy it cannot live without. Libertarians who reject all forms of \u201cfiat currency\u201d unbacked by precious metals, commonly known as \u201cgold bugs\u201d, have grown in influence over the past years. In the US, the most famous libertarian gold bug is probably Ron Paul, whose demand to \u201cEnd the Fed\u201d ran through his 2008 campaign. His son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have also voiced support for a gold standard. Returning to currency that is matched by finite gold reserves could act as a lever to lock in austerity, blocking the expansion of credit and state spending that would be necessary to redress inequality. In Germany, another gold bug, a former precious metals consultant, Peter Boehringer, sits in the Bundestag . His party, the Alternative for Germany, was founded by economics professors in 2013 over the politics of money \u2013 they rejected the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy and management of the eurozone crisis. Another erstwhile gold bug now waits in the antechamber of the Fed itself. Until its recent postponement, Congress was scheduled to vote on the nomination of Judy Shelton to the Fed. Citing Ludwig von Mises and his student Friedrich Hayek as her guides , Shelton has called repeatedly in the past for the return to the \u201csound money\u201d of a gold standard before converting to Trump\u2019s loose monetary policy . For now, alongside the rumblings of a backlash, the actions of the Fed are receiving broad public approval. Elected officials should take this support as a sign that people do not instinctively reject a role for the government in the working of the market under emergency conditions. Lawmakers have time to build on this insight to work with central banks to design economies where uncertainty and hardship are diminished, even after coronavirus has passed. Central banks can be accessories to more equal and just societies, but they can never be the architects. Money must be made to serve the people, not the other way around.

Engines used by Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep vehicles as well as in CNH Industrial's Iveco trucks have been found to contain potentially illegal engine management software to mask excessive pollution levels, Frankfurt prosecutors said. The Frankfurt prosecutor's office stopped short of naming Alfa Romeo and Fiat's parent company, Fiat Chrysler, since under German law only individuals, not companies, can be prosecuted. The investigation targets nine individuals working at an \"internatioal carmaker\" and seeks to establish their role in putting cars equipped with potentially illegal emissions software on public roads the prosecutor's office said. A spokesman for FCA said that a number of the group's offices in Europe were visited by investigators in the context of a request for assistance by magistrates in Germany, adding that it was cooperating fully with authorities. In a similar emailed statement, CNH Industrial confirmed that a number of its offices in Europe have been visited by investigators after a request by German magistrates and that it was cooperating fully with authorities. FCA and CNH Industrial are both controlled by Exor <EXOR.MI>, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family. Potentially illegal software has been detected in the 1.3 litre Multijet and 1.6 litre Multijet engines used in Alfa Romeo, Jeep and Fiat engines as well as in commercial diesel engines used in Iveco and Fiat commercial vehicles, the prosecutors said. Although these cars passed pollution tests in a laboratory, the cars used software to largely switch off exhaust emissions filtering while driving on the road, they added. The investigation, which is coordinated by EU justice agency EUROJUST, focuses on nine individuals living in Italy and their activities between 2014 to 2019, they said.

The factory is seen as vulnerable and its owner, PSA, has already stopped investing in it.\nPhotograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Peugeot could demand compensation from the British government to keep its Vauxhall factory in Ellesmere Port open in the event of a bad Brexit deal, its chief executive has said. Carlos Tavares, the head of Peugeot\u2019s owner, PSA, said the carmaker\u2019s European workers should not be forced to bear the costs of \u201ccustoms barriers\u201d between the UK and the EU when the transition period finishes at the end of the year. Carmakers have voiced concerns about the future trading relationship between the UK and EU, with repeated warnings that tariffs and customs checks could threaten the survival of large parts of the industry. The Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire, which employs about 1,000 people, is seen as particularly vulnerable because a decision on building a new Vauxhall Astra model is overdue. PSA, which is merging with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , has already stopped investment in the factory. In a call with journalists on Tuesday, Tavares said: \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t find a business case \u2026 we would have to ask the UK government to compensate for that, because it is not ethically acceptable that we ask the continental European workers to pay for the customs barriers to enter the UK market. \u201cThere is a point in time that the UK government needs also to respect its own people by creating conditions for the business in the UK to fly.\u201d Tavares\u2019s comments came as carmakers arranged phone calls and online launch events to replace the Geneva motor show , which was cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak that has already rocked the global car industry. BMW executives swapped handshakes for fist bumps as they unveiled their new i4 electric car concept, a version of which is due to go on sale next year. The presentation was streamed from its Munich headquarters a day after the company quarantined 150 research and development employees after a colleague caught the virus. On a call with journalists, Ola K\u00e4llenius, the chairman of the Mercedes-Benz owner, Daimler, said the company had been gradually increasing production at its Beijing plant since 10 February. The outbreak had highlighted the need to track supply chains back to source, he added. \u201cThis is really day-by-day management,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is too early to tell what the full impact will be.\u201d Tavares said coronavirus had been a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for carmakers that they must take control of battery supply chains that are heavily dependent on China. Peugeot had been forced to step in to help a South Korean battery producer to increase production at a factory in Poland, with supply chains creaking. Shutdowns of battery materials plants in China in particular could make it more difficult for carmakers to hit EU emissions targets this year and next , according to Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based independent automotive analyst. Under the rules, which came into force at the start of the year, carmakers must reduce average carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold in the EU below an average of 95g per kilometre, or face steep fines. China is the world\u2019s key centre for battery manufacture. Of 442 companies involved in the automotive battery supply chain, 207 are based in China, according to the data supplier MarkLines. Honda said on Tuesday it was temporarily cutting production at its factory in Saitama, Japan, because of difficulties sourcing parts. The British supercar maker McLaren said it was flying in parts to bypass problems in its supply chain. As well as supplies, the outbreak has already hit carmakers\u2019 revenues. Sales have plummeted in China, after the world\u2019s largest car market virtually ground to a halt in early February as quarantine conditions were imposed. European and US sales could also be affected as the virus spreads.

View more All News Press Releases Benzinga Detroit's Automakers Are Stepping Up Their Truck Game As we enter the second half of 2020, the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) are stepping up their game in the truck and SUV segment. Despite the fact we are still far from beating the COVID-19 pandemic, the automakers are increasing their capital spending on the EV segment.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Fiat Chrysler delivered a loss of $1.24 billion during the second quarter, which marks a drop of 232% compared to last year's result. But its Stellantis chapter is set to change its circumstances. After its merger with Groupe PSA, Peugeot's maker (OTC: PUGOY), it will revamp its Warren Truck plant, just outside Detroit, to build the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Once completed, it will add a new product to its Jeep line - a three-row SUV capable of going where there are no roads. FCA is confident it can meet the challenge posed by Ford's new line of Broncos.But Ford's new offering does not have a three-row vehicle. And after the merger, FCAU is set to become the world's fourth largest automaker.Ford Ford's Bronco reboot was unveiled last month, after supposedly receiving 100,000 reservations for the two new models. Also, there is the redesigned Ford F-150 that has been postponed fourth quarter. Ford's Chief Financial Officer, Tim Stone, announced an expected profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter. However, he also warned that the launches of the redesigned F-150, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E will result in the company being in the red during the fourth quarter.But the bottom line is that Ford is poised to be in a much better position for 2021 as several new products will be available for sale. Moreover, Ford recently delivered an unexpected profit of $1.1. billion for its second quarter. But it was due to a one-time $3.5 billion gain on its investment with self-driving software Argo AI, recorded on its statement of financial position as a \"special item,\" as otherwise Ford would have delivered a loss like in the first quarter. Its better-than-expected results were attributed to an efficient operational execution that involved a safe restart of its plants while reducing costs, while its efforts were complemented by a favorable pricing environment.General Motors General Motors also announced that it will boost the production of full-size pickup trucks by 1,000 units per month at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant by expanding its workforce. According to its Chief Financial Officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, GM is at the end of a sweeping change in its truck portfolio. The down time in the last three years is behind GM as this will be its new bright spot. But the giant also left its first quarter profit begin as it swung to an $800 million loss in the second quarter and burned $7.8 billion in cash.Trucks In The Age Of Renewables Overall, there are many developments that pickup truck owners and fans can rejoice in. Moreover, there are many new products to look forward to such as Worksport's product line of solar powered tonneau covers for pickup trucks. Worksport (OTC: WKSP) and its three new technologically advanced light truck tonneau covers will be launched in the U.S very soon. Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling pickup truck for more than four decades. But considering these developments, that may no longer be the case.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

The carmakers argue that subsidies would help kickstart demand as lockdown measures ease and factories reopen, preventing tens of thousands of job losses amid a global slump in car orders . Bosses such as BMW\u2019s chief executive, Oliver Zipse, have publicly called for grant support to apply across traditional internal combustion engines as well as battery-powered cars and hybrids. The heads of European carmakers including BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler and Jaguar Land Rover discussed the plans last week with Frans Timmermans, the European commission\u2019s executive vice-president for the green deal. The carmakers pushed for a Europe-wide scheme part-funded from the EU budget. Last month Timmermans backed tying carbon dioxide emission limits to any subsidy package, but the carmakers have called for a coordinated stimulus across EU countries that would apply to all cars that meet the Euro 6d standard, effectively meaning any new car would be eligible. In the UK, the car industry has focused its efforts on allowing car dealerships to reopen , but the Vauxhall owner Peugeot confirmed that early discussions over a stimulus scheme covering both battery and internal combustion cars were under way. Talks are being led by the business department under Alok Sharma. The UK already subsidises the sale of battery electric cars , which are generally more expensive than internal combustion cars. Environmental campaign groups have said giving subsidies to all cars would be a missed opportunity to promote a green recovery and to help carmakers move towards all-electric cars with zero carbon dioxide exhaust emissions . Greenpeace said any subsidies should be targeted at less wealthy people and should be conditional on internal combustion engine production ending by 2028. \u201cOnly purely electric, small and light vehicles should be eligible,\u201d said Lorelei Limousin, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace. \u201cIf the green recovery means something, these should be binding conditions across the EU. Any financial support for the car industry should also be conditional on the sector taking concrete steps to rapidly end its growing impact on climate breakdown and our health.\u201d A rise in SUVs has meant average car emissions have risen even as combustion engines have become much more efficient. In other words, a scrappage scheme meant to push consumers towards newer cars could raise emissions. \u201cWe need to encourage carmakers to take the leap into electric vehicles rather than help them finance getting rid of their SUV and high-emissions vehicle stocks,\u201d said Pascal Canfin, a French MEP for the liberal Renew Europe group who chairs the European parliament\u2019s environment committee. He added that support should not \u201crepeat the same mistake we did after the 2009 financial crisis, when we reinvested in the economy but deprioritised the environmental crisis. We lost a decade. Today, we do not have a decade left to lose.\u201d Any increase in demand for cars with higher carbon dioxide emissions would run contrary to the direction of travel for the European industry. Under regulations that came into effect at the start of 2020, carmakers who fail to meet carbon dioxide reduction targets will be fined. The UK is planning to mirror the regulations . Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Julia Poliscanova, the clean vehicles director at the campaign group Transport & Environment, said subsidies must not endanger the recent progress made on electric vehicle sales because of the rules. Electric car sales across Europe doubled year-on-year in the first three months of 2020, according to industry data.

PSA and FCA said their response to the EU's request for documentation was already in progress, but had been made more complicated to fulfil due to factors including the COVID-19 emergency. It \"will be transmitted shortly\", the two groups said in joint statement. The previous deadline for the EU's decision was Nov. 13. FCA and PSA aim to finalise their merger in the first quarter of next year. It is set to create the world's fourth largest auto maker, to be named \"Stellantis\". The Commission is investigating whether the deal to create the world's fourth-biggest carmaker would hurt competition in small vans in 14 EU countries and Britain.

Sales in March were 203,000 down on the same month a year earlier, according to data released by the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). March is traditionally one of the strongest months of the year for new car sales because of the release of new number plates. However, this was the weakest March since the late 90s, when the twice-yearly number plate change was introduced. Britain\u2019s car industry was already struggling before the pandemic \u2013 hit by a combination of falling sales, a shift away from diesel vehicles and Brexit uncertainty. Quick guide UK government support for workers and businesses during the coronavirus crisis Show Hide Income subsidies Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to \u00a32,500 a month. There are similar wage subsidies for employees. Loan guarantees for business Government to back \u00a3330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to \u00a35m with no interest for six months for smaller companies. Business rates Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms. Cash grants Britain\u2019s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of \u00a310,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of \u00a325,000. Benefits Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by \u00a31,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits. Sick pay Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above \u00a394.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills. Other Local authorities to get a \u00a3500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief. Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The figures are a stark indication of what happens when economies grind to a halt, said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT. \u201cHow long the market remains stalled is uncertain but it will reopen and the products will be there. In the meantime, we will continue to work with government to do all we can to ensure the thousands of people employed in this sector are ready for work,\u201d he said. Dramatic falls in new car sales have been reported in other European countries that introduced lockdowns earlier than Britain, including Italy, where sales fell 85% in March, France, down 72%, and Spain, which was 69% lower. The second quarter will be the most difficult for the auto industry, according to the investment bank JP Morgan, which has downgraded its global car production forecast for Europe , the Americas and China from 9% to a 19% fall compared with 2019. Forecasts suggest the continued closure of car plants across Europe and North America will cost the auto industry more than $100bn (\u00a382bn) in lost revenues if the shutdown lasts until the end of April. All major European carmakers have suspended production because of disruption caused by the spread of the coronavirus and if this continues as expected until the end of April, this will account for \u20ac66bn (\u00a358bn) in lost sales in Europe, or 2.6m cars. In North America it would lead to lost sales of about $52bn (\u00a342bn), or 2m cars. The calculations have been made by Ian Henry, the owner of the consultancy AutoAnalysis, who produces forecasts for the SMMT, along with the automotive team at consultancy GlobalData. Assembly lines ground to a halt in March as the lockdown across Europe disrupted global supply chains, and analysts predicted large falls in demand in all key markets. Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk All volume manufacturers from BMW to Toyota and Nissan to Jaguar Land Rover sent their workers home after the worsening outbreak on the continent led companies to examine the health implications for their workers . The story was repeated across North America as the Detroit carmakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, shut down their plants . Auto firms initially closed their sites for a number of weeks, saying they would keep the situation under review, but the shutdown is anticipated to last longer than first expected. Henry predicts that each additional week of plant closures in Europe will cost the industry an extra \u20ac8bn (\u00a37bn) in lost production value and similarly $7.5bn (\u00a36bn) in North America. International supply chains complicate the question of when car plants can reopen, Henry said, while it is also difficult to predict when consumers will starting buying cars again. \u201cWhat will be the state of consumer demand after this?\u201d Henry said. \u201cWill the man in the street want to buy a new car? A huge proportion of cars go to companies and fleet managers won\u2019t be looking to buy cars for executives.\u201d Topics Automotive industry BMW Toyota Nissan Jaguar Land Rover Europe Coronavirus outbreak news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story New car sales rise in UK after coronavirus lockdown decline Year-on-year July increase comes as dealerships and factories started to reopen Published: 5 Aug 2020 New car sales rise in UK after coronavirus lockdown decline Northern Ireland to be left out of new UK car emission restrictions Quirk in regulations means vehicles sold there will count as EU sales for strict CO2 limit Published: 2 Aug 2020 Northern Ireland to be left out of new UK car emission restrictions UK car dealership Pendragon to cut 1,800 jobs Owner of dealers such as Evans Halshaw to shed head office and showroom staff as Covid-19 deepens industry crisis Published: 30 Jul 2020 UK car dealership Pendragon to cut 1,800 jobs UK gives Ford \u00a3500m in loan guarantees to support exports Move comes before Bridgend plant is shut by US carmaker but \u2018safeguards jobs\u2019 elsewhere Published: 22 Jul 2020 UK gives Ford \u00a3500m in loan guarantees to support exports Aston Martin raises \u00a3207m in equity and debt after sales slump Published: 26 Jun 2020 Aston Martin raises \u00a3207m in equity and debt after sales slump UK car industry 'could lose one in six jobs due to Covid-19 crisis' Published: 23 Jun 2020 UK car industry 'could lose one in six jobs due to Covid-19 crisis' Jaguar Land Rover to cut more than 1,000 agency staff in UK Published: 15 Jun 2020 Jaguar Land Rover to cut more than 1,000 agency staff in UK Lookers auditor resigns as car dealership delays results again Published: 8 Jun 2020 Lookers auditor resigns as car dealership delays results again More more on this story Most popular World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Bloomberg Tesla Growth Is Musk\u2019s Goal After Profit Opens Path to S&P (Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. managed to stay profitable even in the midst of a global pandemic, but something is still nagging at Elon Musk: the electric-car maker isn\u2019t growing fast enough.The positive quarterly earnings Tesla reported Wednesday were its fourth in a row, again surprising Wall Street analysts and possibly paving the way for its soaring stock to join the S&P 500 Index. But its chief executive officer is in no mood to let his foot off the accelerator, announcing the company will build another new vehicle-assembly plant in Texas and keep lowering the cost of its models.\u201cThe thing that bugs me the most is our cars aren\u2019t affordable enough and we need to fix that,\u201d Musk said during a call with analysts. \u201cWe want to be slightly profitable, maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible. That\u2019s what we want to achieve.\u201dThe results validate the unconventional efforts Musk made to shore up earnings in the midst of the health crisis that\u2019s expected to leave other U.S. automakers posting losses. And the profit further boosted Tesla\u2019s already lofty share price, which has quadrupled since March in part based on speculation the stock could be added to the S&P 500.The shares rose 2.6% to $1,633.99 as of 9:45 a.m. Thursday in New York trading.Musk, 49, announced Tesla would build its second factory in the U.S. near Austin to produce a new battery-powered Cybertruck pickup and the Semi, as well as two existing models for customers on the East Coast. Tesla had been considering an alternate site near Tulsa, Oklahoma, which the CEO said would remain in consideration for future expansion.\u201cI\u2019ve never been more excited or optimistic about Tesla in the history of the company,\u201d Musk said.S&P Calling?Buoyed by optimism about its dominant EV market share and capacity expansion at home and abroad, Tesla\u2019s massive stock gain has vaulted it into the pole position among global automakers.The company reported a profit of 50 cents a share on a GAAP basis, beating analysts\u2019 consensus estimate for a loss of $1.06 a share. Revenue fell from a year ago to $6.04 billion, topping analysts\u2019 expectations for $5.4 billion.The 12-month period of profitability meets criteria that Standard & Poor\u2019s index committee uses when deciding whether to add stocks to the S&P 500. Adding Tesla to the benchmark likely would force money managers who track the index to buy the stock.\u201cTesla was gunning for S&P induction, and they hit their target,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have to pull too many rabbits out of the hat to get there. They did it for reasons that are sustainable.\u201dIn a phone call after Tesla\u2019s results were released, Ray McConville, an S&P Dow Jones Indices spokesman, declined to comment on any individual company and said the index isn\u2019t reconstituted on a pre-determined timeline.\u201cCompanies who meet the eligibility requirements are not automatically added to the index,\u201d McConville said. \u201cThey join a pool of other eligible candidates and are considered for inclusion when an opportunity presents itself at which point the index committee takes several factors into account such as sector balance and size representation.\u201dCredit BoostTesla cautioned that achieving its goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles this year has become more difficult. In January, it said it expected to \u201ccomfortably exceed\u201d that level of deliveries for the year.The carmaker handed over 90,650 vehicles in the second quarter, up from 88,400 in the first three months of the year despite a lengthy shut down at its factory in Fremont, California.Tesla\u2019s sales of regulatory credits to other automakers rose to a record $428 million. That contributed to its hearty 25.4% automotive gross margin and cushioned against the negative impact of the coronavirus, which halted production and complicated deliveries.The Palo Alto, California-based company has benefited from mandates requiring automakers to sell electric and other non-polluting vehicles in proportion to their market share, or make up for any deficiency by purchasing credits from other carmakers. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said last year it would pool its fleet with Tesla\u2019s to comply with strict new environmental regulations in Europe.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Competitors buying credits arguably had more to do with Tesla\u2019s 1H profit than the company\u2019s operations. As was the case in 1Q, Tesla\u2019s regulatory credit revenue -- $428 million that essentially has no cost associated with it -- was more than the net, pretax and operating income and free cash flow for the period.\\-- Kevin Tynan, global autos analystClick here to read the researchThe value of those credit sales has been growing, rising from $354 million in the first quarter and $133 million in the last three months of last year. Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said he expects revenue from regulatory credits to double this year from 2019, but eventually the business will fade as other automakers ramp up production of their own battery-powered vehicles.Global PushTesla is speedily transitioning into a global manufacturer, having added a new plant in Shanghai, breaking ground on another in Germany earlier this year and now expanding U.S. capacity with the factory in Texas. Tesla said construction for Model Y lines in the Shanghai factory is progressing as planned, with first deliveries expected in 2021.Musk said demand for Tesla models exceeds supply and that the company\u2019s biggest problem is resolving supply chain snafus.While sales of electric vehicles still account for just a fraction of new-car sales, Tesla has built a commanding lead in the fast-growing market. Global EV sales exceeded 2.1 million vehicles last year, less than 3% of overall car sales but a 40% increase over 2018, according to the International Energy Agency.The Texas plant will allow Tesla expand production in the U.S. -- still its largest market -- as it grows its product lineup and seeks to maintain its advantage over rival automakers plotting their own EV push. Tesla told local officials in Texas it wanted to start construction in the third quarter of this year on a 4 million to 5 million-square-foot plant that will employ 5,000 workers.The earnings give ammunition to Tesla\u2019s investor base and run counter to warnings from short sellers and other critics who doubted the company could end its era of frequent losses.Musk said Wednesday that he aims to remain in the black, but not at the expense of sales growth and vehicle affordability. \u201cWe need to not go bankrupt, but we\u2019re not trying to be super profitable either,\u201d he said.(Updates with stock trading in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. \u00a9 2020 Verizon Media.

Honda, BMW and Toyota joined a rapidly lengthening list of carmakers halting European operations on Wednesday, Jaguar Land Rover , the UK\u2019s largest auto firm, as the only one still operating UK plants. The latest closures mean the coronavirus outbreak has temporarily stopped the production lines at plants that employ about 20,000 workers and make more than 1m of the UK car industry\u2019s annual output of 1.5m vehicles. As the pandemic brought the automotive industry grinding to a virtual halt , the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders\u2019 (SMMT) chief executive, Mike Hawes, warned that the industry \u201cstands on the precipice\u201d. Automotive experts voiced concerns that the UK car industry, already struggling to avert decline, may not regain lost ground once the outbreak is over. \u201cLast year, with the uncertainty over Brexit, the shift away from China [amid falling sales] and diesel, it was the perfect storm. This is perfect storm part two,\u201d said Prof David Bailey of Birmingham Business School. \u201cAs assemblers [manufacturers] shut down, it has a cascade effect on the supply chain and some of those firms will have to start shutting down too. \u201cThe fear is a scarring effect. If capacity is lost because of shutdowns, the longer that they go on, the more there is likely to be a permanent impact on an industry that has already been struggling.\u201d He urged the government to consider a wage subsidy scheme to prevent workers being laid off and losing capacity in the sector permanently. Prof Karel Williams at Manchester Business School said it was likely the UK car industry would emerge from the coronavirus crisis smaller than it otherwise would have been. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from what Volkswagen has been saying that lost sales will not be found again and there will be a massive hit in terms of loss-making in the major carmakers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe markets will recover but the companies will be weakened just when they\u2019re requiring large-scale investments in electrification. That will force them to rethink their portfolios of factories, models and markets.\u201d He said existing weakness in the UK auto sector meant firms may sacrifice their British operations to aid their long-term recovery. \u201cThe review of factories, models and markets is not going to be good for the British car industry,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe last thing the industry needs is a major disruption to both demand and supply. The more marginal the operations, the model and the market, the more likely things are to be cut.\u201d About 20,000 UK car workers have been sent home temporarily across the UK industry, while Mercedes-Benz parent, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot have announced broader suspensions of European output. Jaguar Land Rover kept its UK sites operating but has frozen output at its Slovak factory. The suspensions announced on Wednesday will affect Honda\u2019s Swindon plant, already earmarked for closure in 2022, BMW\u2019s Mini plant at Cowley in Oxfordshire and Toyota\u2019s plant at Burnaston in Derbyshire. The three sites employ more than 11,000 people and produce more than 500,000 cars between them annually. UK manufacturers to regear factories to build ventilators for NHS Read more BMW\u2019s chief executive, Oliver Zipse, said the interruption was expected to last until 19 April, while Honda\u2019s will run until at least 6 April. BMW said profits this year would be significantly lower due to the interruptions at plants that accounted for half of the 2.6m cars it built in 2019. Toyota stopped output at more of its plants in Europe and Asia, including factories in Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Jaguar Land Rover, which has plants at Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Halewood,is responsible for almost all of the UK\u2019s remaining production capacity. The firm said it was following government advice but had not yet decided to stop work at UK factories, although work at Nitra in Slovakia will be suspended. The fresh suspensions come a day after Nissan closed its Sunderland factory , Britain\u2019s biggest car plant \u2013 joining the aerospace giant Airbus in ceasing production.

Photograph: Independent Photo Agency/Alamy Italian tycoon Carlo De Benedetti, the former owner of La Repubblica, is launching a new newspaper, Domani. Photograph: Independent Photo Agency/Alamy Published on Sun 9 Aug 2020 07.11 BST C arlo De Benedetti, the former owner of La Repubblica , one of Italy\u2019s biggest daily newspapers, is no stranger to a challenge. Now, at the age of 85, the tycoon is about to embark on what might be his biggest one to date \u2013 launching a newspaper in the midst of a serious financial slump. De Benedetti wants the newspaper, due to launch online and in print in mid-September, to be a progressive, independent voice in a market weighed down by political and economic influence. And, as its name \u2013 Domani (Tomorrow) \u2013 suggests, the focus will be on coverage that looks to the future. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean to say that we won\u2019t take into account historical references,\u201d he told the Observer . \u201cThis will be a post-Covid 19 newspaper born alongside the hope for the country\u2019s reconstruction.\u201d The ambitious project, with newspapers struggling with a drop in advertising as a result of the pandemic, will be funded by De Benedetti using \u20ac20m of his own money before transferring ownership to a foundation. \u201cIt will be the only Italian newspaper owned by a foundation, and one of the few in Europe, including the Guardian ,\u201d he said. \u201cThe foundation will secure the absolute independence of the newspaper.\u201d The newspaper\u2019s success will depend on subscribers \u2013 the website will start immediately with a paywall while print version will contain 16 pages. Despite a cluttered market in Italy, De Benedetti believes there is room for a newspaper that focuses on \u201cfacts, not chatter\u201d, and which is not owned by someone with outside economic interests or linked to a political party. De Benedetti, who made his fortune at Olivetti, the electronics group, stepped down as chairman of all his industrial and media companies in 2009. In 2012, he transferred his stake in GEDI, the media group that owns La Repubblica and La Stampa , to his three sons. He tried to regain control last year, after publicly criticising his sons\u2019 management of the business. But his bid was rejected and the group\u2019s ownership went to the Elkann-Agnelli family, owners of Fiat, the car manufacturer, and Juventus football club. De Benedetti said that changes in newspaper ownership in recent years have left a gap in the market for a liberal, progressive voice: \u201cToday, the scenario of Italian newspapers is characterised by the point of view of the owner, one who has a prevalent economic interest outside of the newspaper \u2013 this for me is wrong.\u201d This will be a newspaper against inequality, on the side of the weakest in society and critical of all powers \u2013 economic and political Carlo De Benedetti And he added: \u201cAlso in Italy, newspapers are either rightwing or centre, there is no longer a newspaper that reflects the liberal world.\u201d Seventeen journalists, including a German speaker, have been hired to work at Domani , which will be based in Rome and edited by 35-year-old Stefano Feltri. The newspaper will be pro-European \u2013 De Benedetti said that Italy outside of Europe would be like \u201ca ship lost in the Mediterranean\u201d \u2013 and focus on the environment, economics and international affairs. \u201cOf course, we will write about politics too, but we\u2019re not interested in political brawling or chatter \u2013 for years, newspapers have been full of political chat that no longer interests anyone,\u201d De Benedetti said. \u201cThis will be a newspaper against inequality, on the side of the weakest in society and critical of all powers \u2013 economic and political.\u201d Domani will also focus more on news and facts, rather than opinion: \u201cThere is place for opinion pieces in a newspaper, but they need to be distinct from facts,\u201d he said. The environment will be among the main issues in the newspaper\u2019s coverage, he added: \u201cMy generation has contributed towards ruining the world. I want my final venture to be a contribution towards not repeating the mistakes of the past.\u201d Topics Newspapers The Observer Italy Europe Newspapers & magazines news Reuse this content World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The shutdown in China has disrupted the global supply chain as carmakers struggle to source the tens of thousands of parts needed for each car. This week, Ralf Speth, the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said the company had been forced to fly parts in suitcases from China to the UK as supplies continued to dwindle. Fiat Chrysler has warned it could halt production at one of its four European plants if the supply from China continues to be affected. Toyota and Peugeot-Citroen said their supply chains may be affected but neither expected to close UK plants as a result.

But this courtroom, unlike the one he has avoided in Tokyo, gave the defendant free rein to explain why he\u2019s innocent, M\u2019Lud. Ghosn spent an hour presenting his own case, and then fended off suggestions that his fugitive status implies guilt. But what did we learn? 1) Ghosn blames a conspiracy between Nissan executives and forces within the Japanese government to bring him down. He named former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, whistleblower Hari Nada and board member Masakazu Toyoda, adding: My unimaginable ordeal is the result of a handful of unscrupulous, vindictive individuals. He refused to name which government officials are to blame, beyond appearing to absolve PM Shinzo Abe. 2) Japan\u2019s judicial system is in the spotlight. Ghosn makes a fair point when he criticises the Japanese habit of forcing confessions out of those accused of crimes. Pouring out his anguish, the former CEO said: I was brutally taken from my work as I knew it, ripped from my work, my family and my friends. It is impossible to express the depth of that deprivation and my profound appreciation to be able to be reunited with my family and loved ones. (I was) interrogated for up eight hours a day without any lawyers present. \u2018It will get worse for you if you don\u2019t just confess\u2019, the prosecutor told me repeatedly. 3) Ghosn claims he has proof that he\u2019s innocent . Reporters were shown some documents which -- apparently -- explain away the $11m of dubious expense payments. He also produced a letter approving the houses bought for the Ghosn family, signed by Saikawa. Ghosn says he plans to prove his innocence. I don\u2019t consider myself as a prisoner in Lebanon. I prefer this prison to the one before. I am ready to stay a long time in Lebanon, but I am going to fight because I have to clear my name. 4) He\u2019s burned his bridges in Japan. Savaging the Tokyo prosecutor is one thing. But citing Pearl Harbor as an example of Japanese cunning and secrecy is to deploy the diplomatic skills of Basil Fawlty. Ghosn\u2019s point is that he didn\u2019t spot how his one-time allies were plotting to boot him out, to break Renault\u2019s control over Nissan - and scupper a planned merged with Fiat-Crysler. But still, it was a poor analogy that will distract from Ghosn\u2019s claims of innocence. 5) He\u2019s devoted to Mrs Ghosn. I think Ghosn was trying to be chivalrous when he joked that he missed his wife badly when he was trapped in Japan, even if others might not . As he touchingly put it: I\u2019ve been in a kind of nightmare for 13 months. It started when I saw the face of the prosecutor, and it ended when I saw the face of my wife. This love is not unrequited -- Carole has spoken about how her husband\u2019s return was a \u201cbeautiful surprise\u201d . They share something else too -- charges in Japan. In her case, prosecutors claim she committed perjury last year. Former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn arrives with his wife Carole today Photograph: -/AFP via Getty Images 6) Lebanon might not be as safe as he hoped. Fleeing to Beirut looked like a cunning plan, as there\u2019s no extradition treaty with Japan. But there is a law banning travel to Israel, which Ghosn has broken in the past. Beirut\u2019s prosecutor wants to discuss this with Ghosn tomorrow, alongside the Red Notice issued by Interpol for his arrest. 7) Be honest, you were hoping to hear Ghosn confirm whether he was bundled out of Toyko in a big musical box. I certainly was . But on this point, he remained tight-lipped. Perhaps he\u2019s saving it for the film version (although he denies that there\u2019s a deal with Netflix). Updated at 4.14pm GMT Facebook Twitter 3.26pm GMT 15:26 After two and half hours, Carlos Ghosn\u2019s press conference is ending as it began, with the former car chief insisting he is innocent. If I\u2019d had any hope of a fair trial, I\u2019d never have fled, he says. He also criticises prosecutors for issuing an arrest warrant for his wife Carole, for allegedly giving false information. Why do that nine months afterwards? And with that, he\u2019s finished. Facebook Twitter 3.21pm GMT 15:21 Q: Are you the Dreyfus of Lebanon? Ghosn says he doesn\u2019t understand the reference (to Alfred Dreyfus, the French captain, who was wrongly convicted of passing military secrets to Germany). Q: It means are you a victim? Yes I am, says Ghosn firmly. He says that several law professors say they cannot understand why he was arrested, especially as some of the alleged financial misconduct refers to money that wasn\u2019t even paid out. Facebook Twitter 3.17pm GMT 15:17 Ghosn: It's been a 13-month nightmare Q: What were your emotions during your escape? Ghosn says he was numb, from the start of the drama until he met his wife Carole in her parents\u2019 home in the Lebanon. I\u2019ve been in a kind of nightmare for 13 months. It started when I saw the face of the prosecutor, and it ended when I saw the face of my wife. Q: Would you recommend a packing case as a mode of travel? Ghosn breaks into a grin, but won\u2019t confirm that rumour that he was smuggled out of Japan in a large box. Facebook Twitter 3.13pm GMT 15:13 Q: Can the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance succeed without you? Yes, says Ghosn modestly - but it needs to follow some rules. Facebook Twitter 3.13pm GMT 15:13 Ghosn says he is ready to answer questions from the French authorities, who last year launched an inquiry into his wealth . Facebook Twitter 3.09pm GMT 15:09 Incidentally, the much-pined-after Carole Ghosn is attending today\u2019s press conference, supporting her man. Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images Facebook Twitter 3.06pm GMT 15:06 Ghosn: I missed my wife (even if you wouldn't) Associated Press asks Ghosn what triggered his decision to escape Japan. Ghosn says there were two factors. First, the Tokyo prosecutor kept postponing his trial, saying it wouldn\u2019t begin until 2021. Second, he missed his wife Carole, telling reporters that: For many people, it wouldn\u2019t be a punishment not to see their wife. But for me it was. How sweet. And yet, how rude! Updated at 3.09pm GMT Facebook Twitter 3.01pm GMT 15:01 Channel Four asks Ghosn about the damage to his reputation: Q: Won\u2019t people say that \u2018if a man escapes from a trial in a box there\u2019s no smoke without fire\u2019? Ghosn won\u2019t be lured into confirming the details of his escape. He says many lies have been told about him, and repeats that he wants a fair trial over the claims of financial misconduct. Updated at 3.01pm GMT Facebook Twitter 2.59pm GMT 14:59 Ghosn has reiterated that he had talked to Fiat-Chrysler about a possible merger with Renault, but the deal floundered after his arrest (allowing Peugeot to swoop in instead). Facebook Twitter 2.56pm GMT 14:56 Curiously, Ghosn denies that he resigned from Renault, saying such reports are a \u201ctravesty\u201d. That\u2019s odd, as France\u2019s finance minister Bruno Le Maire announced a year ago that Ghosn had quit as Renault\u2019s chairman and CEO . Renault also announced that he had resigned both roles , but remained as a director.

Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) Some investors have been confused by remarks. To clarify, I am confident the president will do the right thing in temporarily shutting down the country and closing the borders. If that happens, we can win the war against the virus and the markets and the economy will soar. March 18, 2020 He might be right - which his $1.7bn bank balance suggests. But don\u2019t expect stock markets or the economy to \u201csoar\u201d anytime soon. JP Morgan has slashed and burned its forecasts for US economic growth. It now expects gross domestic product - the broadest measure of the economy - to shrink by -4.0% in the first quarter and by -14.0% in the second quarter! The bank expects the US to recover in the last six months of the year.

It\u2019s quite something: \u201cHell is coming!\u201d Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s wrong. Facebook Twitter 6.22pm GMT 18:22 US airlines want $50bn - spent $45bn on own shares and execs Negotiations are now underway to bail out the airlines. Delta announced today that it is going to cut 70% of its flights. They have asked for $50bn which, according to our calculation, is just $5bn more than $45bn they have spent on share buybacks and executive pay over the last five years. Bet they - and US taxpayers - wish they had sat on some of that cash. Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, has demanded that any US government bailout package come with \u201csignificant conditions\u201d that would not allow companies to \u201cenrich shareholders or pad executive bonuses\u201d. US airlines pushing for massive bailout gave $45bn to shareholders in five years Read more Nelson has outlined her plan on Twitter. We won\u2019t let this to look like the bank bailout of 2008, nor can you compare the two. The airline industry didn\u2019t cause the pandemic and money should come with significant conditions to help workers and keep planes flying, not enrich shareholders or pad executive bonuses. Sara Nelson (@FlyingWithSara) The airline industry is in crisis. A lot of people are asking what to do. We have a plan that starts with workers.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) NASDAQ UP 72.2% SINCE OUR GREAT 2016 ELECTION VICTORY! DOW UP 55.8%. The best is yet to come! December 23, 2019 Presidents usually avoid boasting about the stock market, aware that today\u2019s gains can be wiped out by tomorrow\u2019s events. It\u2019s a lesson Trump is learning the hard way. Covid-19 has now erased all the stock market gains of the Trump presidency. After his last speech, markets fell so hard they were temporarily stopped. Now they are open again and still falling. The Dow is now down 9%. Updated at 5.54pm GMT Facebook Twitter 5.21pm GMT 17:21 Up and falling Trading has resumed and the falls continue. Some are blaming it on Trump. Here\u2019s Dan Alpert, investment banker and credit bubble expert: Dan Alpert (@DanielAlpert) And that's it. @realDonaldTrump literally succeeded in tanking the market - shutting it down as it hits it circuit breaker limit loss. He actually did it...the very stable genius! https://t.co/VI2kColI1Z March 18, 2020 Facebook Twitter 5.05pm GMT 17:05 Markets closed down - again Trading has stopped again after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,660 points, or 7.8%, and the S&P 500 dropped over 7%. The indexes are down about 30% from their mid-February highs. Everything is falling today. Oil has plunged 15% to its lowest level in more than 18 years. Gold, usually a safe haven in times of panic, is down 1%. Looks like people want to cash out - they want to take their money and head for the hills until this blows over. Updated at 5.09pm GMT Facebook Twitter 4.59pm GMT 16:59 \u201cShut it down now!\u201d Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is going off on CNBC. He sounds almost on the edge of tears. Says he has been in isolation recently because of fears he could carry the virus and pass it to older, vulnerable people including his dad. Ackman says he has never carried more than $200 in cash but went to the bank recently and took out \u201ca large amount of money\u201d. \u201cCapitalism does not work in an 18 month shutdown,\u201d he says. The Trump administration needs to close everything down in order to get rid of the virus as quickly as possible. \u201cThis is the only answer.\u201d If we don\u2019t jump on this now \u201cAmerica as we know it will end\u201d. Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) Mr. President, the moment you send everyone home for Spring Break and close the borders, the infection rate will plummet, the stock market will soar, and the clouds will lift. We need your leadership now! March 18, 2020 Facebook Twitter 4.43pm GMT 16:43 CEOs tell Trump to 'act boldly' America\u2019s biggest companies are weighing in - calling on Congress to \u201cact boldly\u201d to limit the economic fallout from the pandemic. The Business Roundtable, which speaks for dozens of major US companies including Apple, General Motors, JP Morgan Chase and WalMart, wants a suspension of global tariffs, a temporary halt to payrolls taxes and measures to support the supply chain. The government actions necessary to address this crisis will have enormous costs,\u201d the letter, signed by Walmart boss Doug McMillon, said. \u201cHowever, failure to act boldly now will impose far greater costs to our country and our future.\u201d Updated at 5.52pm GMT Facebook Twitter 4.27pm GMT 16:27 European markets close down - US markets are still falling European markets are now closed after another bad day. In London the FTSE 100 fell over 4%, in Frankfurt the Dax dropped over 5% per cent and in Paris the Cac 40 was down by a similar margin.

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) the act \u201cis the primary source of Presidential authorities to expedite and expand the supply of resources from the US industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs.\u201d The act authorizes the president to: require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense; allocate materials, services and facilities to national defense; and gives him greater control over scarce and/or critical materials. The act became law on September 8, 1950, in response to the start of the Korean War. Facebook Twitter 3.59pm GMT 15:59 Trump speaks We are waiting for Trump to speak. The White House is asking Congress for $500bn that would pay for two emergency payments to US taxpayers. According to the New York Times , which has seen a draft of the proposal: The Treasury Department proposal calls for the authority to send two $250 billion rounds of checks directly to American taxpayers, the first on April 6 and the second May 18. Payments would be fixed, and their size dependent on income and family size, the summary said.
