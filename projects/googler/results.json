The Johnnie Walker whisky maker took the 1.3 billion pound non-cash writedown related to its businesses in India, Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Windsor whisky brand in South Korea, blaming challenging trading conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On Tuesday, the company reported an 8.4% drop in organic sales for the year ended June 30, larger than the 7.3% fall analysts had expected, company supplied estimates showed. This marks the company's worst annual sales performance in more than a decade, according to Bernstein analysts. Diageo shares were down 6.2% in early trading and was the biggest loser on the FTSE <.FTSE>. The stock is down nearly 10% this year, better than the FTSE's 20% decline over the same period. By region, organic sales in Asia fell the most, dropping 16% due to the impact of coronavirus-related closures of alcohol outlets and bars in India and Thailand, while in China demand was hit by the absence of the Chinese New Year. The company's Latin America, Africa and Europe and Turkey markets also posted double-digit falls in sales, mainly due to disruptions to supply chains and fewer social occasions due to the pandemic. North America was the only bright spot, with sales rising 2%, reflecting strong demand for tequilas and ready-to-drink beverages at supermarkets and alcohol stores, the company said. Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said the strong results in North America, its biggest market by revenue, was because 80% of Diageo's sales came from retail stores, in contrast to other markets, where bars and restaurants make up most of the sales. The company, which also makes Tanqueray Gin, Smirnoff Vodka and a wide range of scotch whiskey, said it was still unable to provide specific outlook for the year, after abandoning a full-year forecast in April. Its 4.5 billion pound capital returns programme remains suspended. \"The hit to earnings should be short lived provided the global economy doesn't take too long to recover,\" William Ryder, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said. \"We think the group will continue to do well long term, but management will have to focus more on debt reduction than they probably would have liked.\" The company also said it would keep paying a dividend, which Liberum analyst Nico Von Stackelberg called a \"positive sign\". After a tough second half of the year \"we should see sequential improvements (in the business) from here,\" he said in a note. Diageo's business outlook was in contrast to French spirits makers Pernod Ricard <PERP.PA> and Remy Cointreau <RCOP.PA> , which last month said the pandemic would not hit their full-year forecasts as strongly as initially feared. Diageo's impairment charge follows those of other alcoholic beverage makers, AB InBev <ABI.BR> and Heineken <HEIN.AS>. While AB Inbev took a $2.5 billion writedown related to its African operations last week, Heineken announced a nearly 550 million euro writedown on Monday.

McCombie Fool.co.uk 8 June 2020 Reblog Share Tweet Share Shelves holding drinks bottles More I think Young\u2019s (LSE: YNGA) is the best pub stock to buy today as pubs look set to open early than expected. Ministers are pushing for outside spaces, like beer gardens and terraces, to be allowed to open on 22 June. Inside spaces should open later on 4 July. However, I would caution investors against getting overly optimistic about the pub sector in general. Its a pub, just not as we know it For one thing, a new spike in coronavirus infections could push back the reopening dates, or force pubs to shut again. For another, the planned reopenings will be very restrictive. Two-metre social distancing will limit customer numbers to under 40% of normal. There will be queues to get in and for toilets, and propping up the bar will not be allowed. Some pub chains have already opened for takeaway during the spell of sunny weather. Passing pints over the walls to customers to consume elsewhere was not widespread, and you have to wonder why. It might be because supermarkets and corner shops already sell alcohol for consumption off the premises. Or it could be because most pubs didn\u2019t want to risk people getting drunk in public on their beer. It could also be that a takeaway service did not make financial sense. Pubs are burning through cash as premises sit idle, but they could continue to do so with limited openings. I think the number of staff will need to be something like a world cup semi-final would call for, but with a fraction of the customers. And those customers might not be knocking their drinks back like they used to. Pacing themselves Young\u2019s boss has said none of its pubs will open before early August. Given that Young\u2019s has already warned of a substantial loss for 2020 and has cut its dividend, it might sound mad to pass on the option to open early. But I see Young\u2019s not in a hurry to rush an opening as a reason why its the best pub stock to buy today. The company has already informed investors that it could remain closed without going bust until March 2021. It has made use of the government\u2019s job retention and business rate relief schemes, and will not want to jeopardise them until it makes sense to do so. Young\u2019s management expects social distancing rules of one-metre in August, which should allow pubs to operate at around 70% of capacity. At over two-thirds capacity, it seems Young\u2019s management is confident of at least not adding to the losses it is already making. It could also learn from the experiences of other pubs that may open this month, and avoid a potentially tricky emergency shut down should the outbreak spike again in the coming weeks. Last orders, please Getting a slice of Young\u2019s pre-crisis revenue, earnings, and dividend growth would be a steal at the current share price. Emerging from the crisis in an orderly fashion and avoiding doing more damage will help Young\u2019s get back on track. Having management brave enough to keep doors shut until it makes sense to open \u2013\u00a0and having the financial strength to allow this \u2013\u00a0bodes well for Young\u2019s.

This might drive the stock higher in the near term. Bloomberg High-Flying EV Maker Nikola Plummets in Bumpy Earnings Debut (Bloomberg) -- Nikola Corp.\u2019s first earnings report was a bumpy one, with executives and analysts trading barbs and investors sending the electric-truck maker\u2019s shares plunging.The stock fell 18% in late trading after the company, which develops big rigs that run on batteries and fuel cells, said it lost $86.64 million in the second quarter, a five-times greater net loss than a year ago.Within minutes of Nikola releasing its statement, its founder Trevor Milton was tweeting that the Phoenix-based company had provided analysts figures on the company\u2019s share count. He wrote that taking those figures into account, the manufacturer beat expectations, contrary to some who said it fell short.Analysts responded in kind by pressing Chief Executive Officer Mark Russell on Nikola\u2019s earnings call for more information on new customers, production timing and any confirmation of a partnership with a manufacturer that will build the company\u2019s electric pickup model, called the Badger.\u201cSo, Mark, I just wonder, is this all we get?\u201d Paul Coster, an analyst at JPMorgan who rates Nikola the equivalent of a buy, said to Russell. Jeff Osborne of Cowen said trying to follow timelines Milton has been communicating on social media has been \u201ca bit confusing.\u201d Nikola hopes to begin testing the battery-electric version of its first semi truck, the Tre, with select customers in 2021. The company has a joint venture with CNH Industrial NV\u2019s Iveco truck unit to start limited production of the vehicle in Ulm, Germany, at the end of next year. Trucks powered by hydrogen fuel cells will be built in Coolidge, Arizona, starting in 2023, where the company broke ground on its first U.S. manufacturing plant last week.Russell declined during the call to name any new customers beyond Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, which has previously announced ordering 800 fuel-cell semis. In a phone interview, Russell said the company has potential buyers around the world.\u201cWe had a fleet week in Europe where we bring the customers in, and we have had representatives of a good chunk of the market in our headquarters,\u201d Russell said. \u201cA good chunk of the target customers have been to see us. We\u2019ve been in conversation with them for some time.\u201dNikola listed its shares in early June following a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company and quickly saw its market capitalization surge to almost $29 billion, at one point surpassing Ford Motor Co.\u2019s valuation. Lordstown Motors Corp. and Fisker Inc. are now trying to follow suit.After ending the quarter with $707.3 million in cash and equivalents, Milton said in an interview that Nikola\u2019s focus will be on financial prudence as it brings products to market. The company expects to raise another $264.5 million by redeeming stock warrants.\u201cWe run a really tight ship here and we do spend money, but only when it\u2019s needed,\u201d Milton said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to succeed and others have failed. They spent money like it\u2019s just handed out.\u201d(Updates with founder\u2019s tweets starting in the third paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Why Earnings Season Could Be Great for Arlo Technologies (ARLO) Zacks Beyond Meat Falls On Q2 Earnings Benzinga MarketWatch Moderna's stock rallies as it moves forward with enrolling its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial Shares of Moderna Inc.  gained 1.9% in premarket trading on Wednesday after the company said it plans to complete enrollment for the Phase 3 trial for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in September and that it has already received $400 million in deposits in preparation of the experimental vaccine's regulatory authorization. Moderna, founded in 2010, is considered a preclinical company because it does not market any approved medical products. \"As we pivot to a commercial-stage company, we recognize the need for responsible pricing in the face of the pandemic,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a news release. Moderna is developing one of the frontrunning COVID-19 vaccines, and the orders and government funding for its candidate have shifted the company's balance sheet this year. Moderna had a loss of $116.5 million, or 31 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2020, compared with a loss of $134.9 million, or 41 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. It had revenue of $66.3 million in the quarter, up from $13.1 million in the like quarter in 2019, with the company attributing the increase to COVID-19 funding and unrelated collaboration revenue from AstraZeneca . Its general and administrative expenses were $36.6 million for the past three months, compared with $28.5 million for the same period a year ago. The company has $3.07 billion in cash, as of June 30, up from $1.26 billion in December. Moderna's stock has soared 301.1% year-to-date, while the S&P 500  is up 2.3%.

Concurrently the B3 ratings of the outstanding GBP307 million senior secured term loan B1 due 2024 and $410 million senior secured term loan B2 due 2024, and the GBP75 million revolving credit facility due 2023 (RCF) have also been downgraded to Caa1. Outlook on all ratings is negative. The ratings downgrade reflects the pronounced pressure on Clarion's revenue and EBITDA in FY2021 (fiscal year ending 31st January 2021) driven by the cancellation and delays of its trade shows globally, due to the coronavirus outbreak. It remains unclear at this stage if the company's key trade shows will be held as currently planned from September onwards. \"Clarion's leverage is set to deteriorate meaningfully in FY2021 and its liquidity position could become very tight over the coming quarters if cash flow generation turns out to be weaker than we currently expect. Moreover, the prospects of recovery in FY2022 are also highly uncertain\", says Gunjan Dixit, a Moody's Vice President -- Senior Credit Officer and lead analyst for Clarion. This rating action concludes the review for downgrade initiated on Clarion's ratings on 1 April 2020. A full list of affected ratings can be found at the end of this press release. RATINGS RATIONALE The coronavirus outbreak will likely have a more material impact on the company's operating performance and liquidity in FY2021 than previously estimated when the ratings were placed under review for downgrade in April 2020. Since then, the group has cancelled and postponed most of the shows that had been initially scheduled to run between April and September 2020 globally. Clarion did not run any shows in April or May and expects its first shows since the disruptions to run in September, with a return to a comprehensive calendar from October 2020. Moody's now estimates that Clarion's revenue could reduce by about 50% to around GBP200 million in FY2021 compared to GBP400 million in FY2020. The higher than originally anticipated lost revenue, as well as coronavirus related costs will deplete the company's reported EBITDA (after coronavirus related losses) in FY2021 to around GBP 35 million (compared to GBP 112 million in FY2020), despite management's comprehensive cost-cutting actions. Clarion's free cash flow (after capex and working capital) will also be negative in FY2021 by around GBP 60 million, leading to increase in gross debt. Moody's forecasts are based on the assumption that the events scheduled from October go ahead as planned, and bookings for calendar 2021 events continue. Moody's currently expects the company's leverage to spike to 18x in FY2021 with some recovery in FY2022, yet remaining high at around or over 10x. There remains a high degree of uncertainty about recovery in the second half of FY2021 and in FY2022. Moody's currently expects that the shows currently scheduled from October 2020 will go ahead. However, shows will run at reduced capacity as social distancing measures are implemented, and health and safety concerns could force some exhibitors to avoid attending face-to-face events. To survive this difficult period, Clarion has adopted a prudent strategy - (1) to defer events where it can (rather than cancel) and move committed customers with the show; (2) where cancellation is the only option, move the customers booking and any prepaid revenues into the next years' show; (3) work with customers to minimize refunds and with suppliers to delay payments; (4) minimize any non-recoverable sunk costs; (5) explore potential savings of direct and indirect costs; and (6) continue to sell and collect revenues on the shows in the second half of FY2021 and FY2022 shows where possible. At the end of May 2020, Clarion had about GBP95 million of cash on the balance sheet, including the fully drawn GBP 75 million revolving credit facility (RCF) maturing in September 2023. Moody's positively recognizes that the cash balance was ahead of management's guidance in March 2020, helped by the company's efforts towards continued collection of payments, cost-cutting measures, and minimal refunds to date. However, Moody's expects that until September, Clarion's EBITDA and free cash flow will likely be constrained and the company will need to rely on its cash balance to meet its needs. This will leave the company with limited headroom for any operational under-performance or unanticipated working capital cash outflows. Moody's estimates that cash interest of about GBP23 million is also due to be paid between September and November 2020. Story continues While the company's liquidity profile appears tight, Moody's takes some comfort from the fact that Clarion's indirect controlling shareholder, Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) VII, LP, part of The Blackstone Group Inc., has provided a letter confirming that, for a period of a year from the date of the FY2020 annual report, it will provide support to the company up to a fixed amount, if required. However, the form and level of support remain highly unclear at this stage. Moody's also acknowledges that Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) VII, LP, has confirmed that for a period of a year, it does not intend to undertake any decision or action, in its capacity as an indirect controlling shareholder of Clarion, which would reasonably be expected to negatively affect the company's ability to continue as a going concern. Clarion faces no large debt maturities or refinancing risks in the near term. There is a springing covenant that applies to the RCF and is tested when it is more than 40% drawn. The covenant is set at a maximum senior secured leverage to EBITDA ratio of 10.2x. The covenant definition allows exceptional coronavirus-related losses to be excluded from the EBITDA calculation. We therefore forecast Clarion will have some headroom under the covenant over the next 12 months. ESG CONSIDERATIONS The rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak, deteriorating global economic outlook, low oil prices, and high asset price volatility are creating an unprecedented credit shock across a range of sectors, regions and markets. Moody's regards the coronavirus outbreak as a social risk under its ESG framework, given the substantial implications for public health and safety. Today's rating action reflects the impact on Clarion of the breadth and severity of the shock, and the broad deterioration in credit quality it has triggered. RATIONALE FOR NEGATIVE OUTLOOK The negative rating outlook reflects the uncertainty around the resumption of events from September 2020 as well as the weak liquidity profile of the company. Stabilisation of outlook would require (1) resumption of Clarion's events from September onwards and company's performance in line with Moody's base case and (2) sufficient liquidity buffer to be maintained throughout FY2020 and beyond. FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS Negative pressure on the rating could develop should (1) the company's leverage does not improve materially (Moody's-adjusted gross debt/EBITDA, smoothed for biennial events) beyond FY 2021, (2) liquidity deteriorate as a result of a prolonged weakness in the underlying business performance and/ or (3) there be a more permanent reduction in demand for its shows beyond FY2021. Positive pressure on the rating could develop over time should Clarion's leverage (Moody's-adjusted gross debt/EBITDA, smoothed for biennial events) fall below 7.5x on a sustained basis as a result of recovery in operating performance and its liquidity position appears comfortable.

Without any sugar-coating, Big Oil is fighting for its existence. The coronavirus pandemic has turned the world upside down. Leaders around the globe were not up to the challenge of a pandemic. Despite a mild and slow recovery in sight, unemployment is still high, and the U.S. has seen its slowest economic growth rate ever. The combination of worst-ever oil prices, OPEC production cuts, collapsing margins, and oversupply resulting in millions of unsold barrels has harmed even giants in the industry, like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX).Losing Streak Exxon continued its streak of losses as it recently reported a second-quarter loss of $1.1 billion due to global oversupply and COVID-related demand destruction. Its shares are down 40% this year. Moreover, it was topped on the list of the world's largest energy companies by an Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd. The list is led by Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures. Investors turned to the conglomerate lured by its digital and retail expeditions.Layoffs And Slashed Earnings Expectations The reality is that the industry has found itself in an immense demand crater and its profits have disappeared overnight. Moreover, it's not just Exxon. BP p.l.c. (NYSE: BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-B) (NYSE: RDS-A) are in the same basket with layoffs and slashed earnings expectations. Shell is not optimistic as its management openly stated it is aware that its business might never come back.BP just slashed its dividend for the first time since the Deepwater Horizon oil spill as it reported a record loss of $16.8 billion for the second quarter. Even that bleak scenario is still better than the fate of the 23 companies that filed for bankruptcy since this unprecedented year began. The collective debt of oil and gas companies that filed for bankruptcy protection in the first half of 2020 exceeds $30 billion.Exxon is using layoffs to pay out its dividends whereas BP will do the same in an effort to move beyond petroleum as this is the \"right thing to do\". It is clear that Big Oil does not intend to take care of its workforce. And these are the people who kept the industry going since oil was seen as a strategic energy source and a tremendous geopolitical prize during World War I.You Can't Stop What's Coming The oil era has to come to an end at some point, simply because it is not a renewable source. The only question is when will this imminent event take place. Current events are happening at a great speed and at an unprecedented scale due to the pandemic that is threatening humanity as a whole- hand in hand with climate change. News from the US, Europe, and even Asia is triggering concerns that the second wave of the pandemic is about to strike.One thing is certain though - Big Oil is not acknowledging defeat and finds its workers disposable in the face of market downturns or more specifically, its bottom line.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

Bloomberg BP Walks Away From the Oil Supermajor Model It Helped Create (Bloomberg) -- In the late 1990s, BP Plc boss John Browne used an oil-price slump to usher in the age of the supermajor, buying U.S. rivals Amoco and Arco to create a transatlantic giant. He kicked off a round of mergers that saw his company and four others dominate the industry -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. in the U.S., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SE in Europe.That era ended on Tuesday when Bernard Looney, the third chief executive officer since Browne\u2019s swashbuckling reign ended in 2007, declared BP would be a supermajor no more and proposed a very different blueprint for the oil company of the future.Just six months after taking the helm, Looney has put meat on the bones of his plans to make BP compliant with the Paris accord on climate change, saying he\u2019ll cut dividends in half, shrink oil and gas output by 40% over the next decade and spend as much as $5 billion a year building one of the world\u2019s largest renewable-power businesses.Where Browne created a global model, Looney\u2019s strategy shows the oil industry is splitting in two.On one side of the Atlantic, BP, Shell and Total are trying to make themselves going concerns for a low-carbon age, diluting their fossil-fuel businesses with plans to build significant revenues from renewable energy. Exxon and Chevron -- insulated from the pressure applied by European investors and politicians -- are charting a different course: keep pumping as profitably as possible and hand the cash back to investors. Like Big Tobacco, they\u2019re increasingly courting shareholders willing to put returns above the harm their product causes.Pay Out or Diversify\u201cBP had two choices,\u201d said Brian Scott-Quinn, emeritus professor at Henley Business School in southern England, who\u2019s written on financial markets and climate change. \u201cFirst, simply paying out the maximum dividend it can in the future by not investing in the future at all. Alternatively, it can diversify on a much larger scale.\u201dLooney described his seismic shift as making an integrated oil company into an integrated energy company.\u201cYou have to knit together lots of different energy sources,\u201d Looney said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Wednesday. \u201cWe are natural gas, we\u2019re in solar, we\u2019re in wind, we have one of the world\u2019s largest trading organizations.\u201dIt\u2019s a complete change of direction for a company that raised the dividend earlier this year and has been hammered by the post-pandemic crash in oil prices. And there are plenty of risks ahead.BP concedes that power projects still make lower returns than oil and gas investments -- one reason why the board agreed to a lower dividend. And management has acknowledged that hydrocarbon production will probably remain BP\u2019s main source of earnings for \u201cthe next several years,\u201d funding its shift toward cleaner energy.It\u2019s also unclear what competitive advantage an oil company brings to building wind farms and solar parks; traditional power utilities have had a long head-start.But there are dangers for Exxon and Chevron too. As alarm over global warming increases, their universe of potential investors may keep shrinking, especially if Joe Biden takes the White House in November and resets U.S. energy policy. As this quarter\u2019s record losses show, if the post-Covid slump in crude prices is sustained, generating meaningful returns from oil and gas won\u2019t be easy. A decade ago, Exxon was the most valuable U.S. corporation. Today it ranks 41st.See also: Tesla Overtakes Exxon\u2019s Market Value in Symbolic Energy Shift\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a division between the Europeans, who are much more committed to meeting the climate agenda,\u201d and the Americans, said Panmure Gordon & Co. analyst Colin Smith. Their success will depend on how attractive the pivot in investments is perceived to be, relative to continued spending on oil and gas, he said.Unlike their European peers, Exxon and Chevron have managed to bat away investor pressure thus far. Both companies, backed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have resisted requests for shareholders to vote on their emission strategies.But they\u2019ve been struggling with meager returns after investing heavily in megaprojects around the world for a decade, leaving them wholly unprepared for the era of cheap oil that began in 2014. Slow to realize the transformational effect of the shale revolution that happened on their doorstep, Exxon and Chevron are only now understanding that they must become more nimble to respond to market conditions, rather than dictate them.Sticking With OilUnder their current CEOs, neither U.S. major has the will to follow the Europeans down the green path. Both plan to stick with oil and gas long-term, tempered only by small clean-energy technology bets. For them, rushing to renewables -- where they have no competitive advantage and see smaller returns in a more regulated industry -- is not the answer.Yet in Europe, BP\u2019s newly fleshed out plans will no doubt add pressure on Shell, which also announced ambitions earlier this year to slash its carbon emissions by 2050 and increasingly turn to renewables. The Anglo-Dutch major has promised more detail on that shift, which will ultimately result in it only doing business with emission-free companies.For the European majors, the success of their strategy depends in part on governments maintaining the scale of policy support needed to make the energy transition happen. With countries around the world pledging greener economies as they emerge from the devastation of the coronavirus, BP may have chosen its moment wisely.\u201cIf ever there was a moment to reset, this was it,\u201d said Luke Parker, vice president of corporate analysis at consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. \u201cSeveral factors have converged to make it possible: coronavirus and everything that comes with it; a strategic pivot to net-zero on the horizon\u201d and a \u201cnew leadership with credit in the bank.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said sales actually grew 6% on a constant-currency basis, propelled by demand for Macs and iPads from millions now accustomed to working from home. Its out-performance in Greater China -- Apple\u2019s single biggest international market -- drove quarterly revenue well above Wall Street\u2019s forecasts.Apple\u2019s strength in the world\u2019s No. 2 economy surprised analysts who\u2019ve seen local consumers turn increasingly to homegrown brands, at a time Washington accuses the likes of Huawei Technologies Co. and ByteDance Ltd. of spying or jeopardizing national security. Huawei -- the company most squarely in Trump\u2019s cross-hairs -- eclipsed Samsung Electronics Co. in global smartphone sales for the first time last quarter, thanks in large part to an upswell of home-crowd support.Apple, whose Chinese-based suppliers employ upwards of a million people, was swift to adapt its tactics after Covid-19 emerged in February, turning to third-party distributors after shutting most of its stores. It also focused on marketing and selling online, tapping the surge of internet activity that followed a rolling nationwide lockdown.The iPhone maker jumped aboard a plethora of online sales promotions hosted by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. in June, traditionally one of several peak spending months. Apple moved more than 500 million yuan ($72 million) of devices in a single day during JD\u2019s \u201c6.18\u201d shopping marathon, the Chinese company said. It probably also benefited from the introduction of a lower-cost smartphone, the iPhone SE.\u201cApple defied expectations in Q2. Its new iPhone SE was critical in the quarter,\u201d Canalys analyst Vincent Thielke said. \u201cApple is also demonstrating skills in new user acquisition.\u201dRead more: Apple Smashes Revenue, IPhone Estimates on Pandemic DemandFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg Founder Hits Jackpot Thanks to China\u2019s Love of Stock Trading (Bloomberg) -- When the coronavirus put a halt on people\u2019s lives in China in February, Justin Jin\u2019s old university classmates thought about selling face masks to make money. The 21-year-old suggested they instead try their luck with two stocks: Tesla Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.That\u2019s when Jin\u2019s two friends began using the Futubull app, one of the Chinese platforms that allow mainland investors to buy foreign equities. The decision paid off. Both stocks soared as part of a global rally that has enticed a wave of novice investors.\u201cWhen I first started, there were only three or four friends who used Futu,\u201d Jin said. \u201cNow there are at least three or four dozen.\u201dThanks to them and many others, Futu Holdings Ltd., a Chinese online brokerage and wealth-management platform, now counts more than 1 million registered users, a 23% increase from the first quarter. Its American depositary receipts have almost quadrupled since a low in March, propelling the fortune of its founder and chairman, Leaf Hua Li, to $1.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Tencent EmployeeLi, 43, was Tencent\u2019s 18th founding employee and left to start Futu after growing frustrated with the software he used to trade Hong Kong stocks, according to a CapitalWatch interview in January. The online broker, backed by the Chinese internet giant, was formally incorporated under Hong Kong law in April 2012. Li owns 40% of its outstanding shares.A company spokesman declined to comment on Li\u2019s net worth.Retail investors have always been a driving force in China\u2019s stock market, but with the pandemic keeping people home, more amateur traders have emerged. Futu reported a 60% surge in new paying clients -- those with assets in their trading accounts -- in the first quarter, with much of it coming from Hong Kong. Big-name stocks like Tencent, Tesla and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. fueled the surge during the peak of China\u2019s coronavirus crisis in February, according to a statement.One of Futu\u2019s main draws is that, unlike mainland competitors, it has licenses that allow users to go beyond the domestic market and buy equities from the U.S. and Hong Kong. This year\u2019s high-profile secondary listings in the city from JD.com Inc. and NetEase Inc. have enticed more investors, as has the months-long rebound in U.S. stocks, according to Bank of China International analyst Nanyang He.\u201cFutu has benefited from strong market sentiments in terms of raising trading velocity and increasing IPO subscription revenue,\u201d He said.Shares SurgeFutu shares have risen 148% since the company listed in New York in March 2019, outpacing rival Up Fintech Holding Ltd., which went public the same month.While the competition is rife -- Chinese brokerage firm Huatai Securities Co. just launched its own U.S. stock-trading app -- Futu is betting on the increasing number of Chinese citizens looking to diversify their investments globally, He said. The company started a series of MSCI index futures products this month.Li began his career at Tencent after receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science and technology from Hunan University in 2000. He was an early researcher of the QQ messaging software and founded Tencent Video, now one of the largest video-streaming platforms in China.Li credits his time at Tencent for building his business acumen and said he was inspired by the company\u2019s founders, Pony Ma and Zhang Zhidong, according to the CapitalWatch interview. Tencent remains Futu\u2019s largest institutional backer, and several of its employees were key in helping the online broker grow over the past decade.Still, Li hopes he\u2019ll ultimately be defined by his legacy at Futu.\u201cFor a long time, people wondered why I left Tencent at its peak of growth,\u201d Li said in the interview. \u201cNow that Futu has made it, the weight of importance has changed.\u201d(Updates share move since IPO in 10th paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. Bloomberg Tencent Offers $2.1 Billion for Chinese Search Giant Sogou (Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd. has offered to buy out and take private search engine Sogou Inc. in a $2.1 billion deal, adding to a slew of Chinese technology giants seeking to delist from U.S. bourses.Shares of the social media heavyweight climbed as much as 4.7% Tuesday, buoyed by speculation it will more closely integrate Sogou\u2019s AI technology with its own services and devices to gain an edge on rivals like TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd.Tencent has in past years come under pressure from ByteDance and other up-and-coming rivals in the emergent short-video arena. Beijing-based Sogou -- whose name translates as \u201csearch dog\u201d -- has long been the default in a slew of Tencent products including its marquee social app WeChat. It\u2019s also been making a push into artificial intelligence.A takeover of Sogou also raises the prospect of a lucrative listing in Hong Kong or Shanghai in the future, on the heels of well-received debuts by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. It\u2019s become an increasingly attractive route for tech giants such as Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group, which is speeding toward what could be the city\u2019s biggest float in years. Sogou Chief Executive Officer Wang Xiaochuan in 2018 declared his ambition to list on mainland bourses when regulations permit.Chinese internet companies are exploring listings closer to home after a proposed U.S. bill threatened to force them to delist from New York by imposing stricter disclosure requirements -- a prospect that looks increasingly plausible as the Trump administration amps up action against Beijing on multiple fronts. Online gaming company Changyou.com Ltd. got taken private this year by Sohu.com Ltd., and 58.com Inc. is being bought out by a private equity consortium for $8.7 billion.The \u201cmarket has been anticipating more companies to pursue secondary listing in Hong Kong,\u201d Jefferies analysts led by Thomas Chong wrote. \u201cWe consider there will be more synergies between Sogou and Tencent in search and smart devices in the future.\u201dWhat Blomberg Intelligence SaysTencent\u2019s return to the search engine business may pose a challenge to China leader Baidu, and help fend off competition from potential market entrants ByteDance and Alibaba. Tencent sold search engine Soso to Sogou in 2013. Its bid to buy the 61% of Sogou it doesn\u2019t yet own at $9 per ADS will cost more than $2 billion.\\- Vey-Sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analystsClick here for the research.Tencent is offering $9 in cash for each American depositary share it doesn\u2019t already hold in Sogou, backed by fellow internet giant Sohu. That\u2019s a 57% premium to the target company\u2019s Friday close. Sogou said in a statement it was considering the takeover offer, though Tencent already owns about 39.2% of Sogou but controls a majority of voting power.Sogou, founded in 2005 and merged with Tencent\u2019s Soso search business in 2013, has counted on its partnership with the larger company to help it catch search leader Baidu Inc. Its 2017 IPO also helped bankroll a longer-term AI effort -- about three quarters of its employees are now involved in research and development, according to its website.Sohu\u2019s shares gained 40% in New York, their most in a decade, while Sogou leapt a record 48% to close the gap with the offer price.(Updates with Tencent share action from the second paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. \u00a9 2020 Verizon Media.

Motley Fool Schlumberger Takes $3.7 Billion Charge As It Downsizes The oilfield services company is cutting more than 21,000 jobs in the midst of the oil market downturn. Bloomberg Schlumberger Shrinking Staff to Lowest Since Pre-Shale Era (Bloomberg) -- Schlumberger Ltd. said it\u2019s cutting one-fifth of its workforce as the oil services giant warned that new waves of Covid-19 could derail the nascent recovery in global energy demand.The Houston-based company on Friday posted its worst quarterly sales in 14 years, reflecting the devastating impact of this year\u2019s plunge in drilling activity on the hired hands of the oil patch. Like its peers Halliburton Co. and Baker Hughes Co., which also reported earnings this week, Schlumberger has borne the brunt of massive cutbacks in energy industry spending.\u201cThis has probably been the most challenging quarter in past decades,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch said in the statement. \u201cSubsequent waves of potential Covid-19 resurgence pose a negative risk to this outlook.\u201dSchlumberger said it\u2019s letting go more than 21,000 employees, shrinking staffing to an 11-year low. It incurred $1 billion severance costs in the quarter, in addition to another $2.7 billion of various restructuring and impairment charges.Despite disastrous results in some business lines -- North American onshore fracking and other sales tumbled 60% from the previous quarter\u2019s level -- Le Peuch shielded the 12.5-cent-a-share dividend from additional reductions. Just three months ago, the CEO reduced the payout for the first time in more than 40 years.Schlumberger shares fell 1.6% to $18.99 at 11:44 a.m. in New York. Adjusted earnings of 5 cents a share compared with the penny loss expected by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.The number of wells drilled worldwide this year is expected to drop by almost a quarter, with no forecast of a full recovery in the coming years, according to industry consultant Rystad Energy.With that in mind, Schlumberger is cutting its workforce by about a fifth compared with the 105,000 it employed at the end of 2019. Le Peuch told analysts during a conference call that more belt-tightening is on the way: The company has achieved 40% of its $1.5 billion in cost cuts for the year, which means another $900 million in reductions still to be incurred.Schlumberger is the last of the big three oil service companies to report second-quarter results. Halliburton impressed investors with better-than-expected cost cuts while announcing a new strategy to role out more technology and look internationally for better revenue growth. Baker Hughes warned investors of a possible second wave of coronavirus cases leading to lockdowns again.(Updates share price in sixth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. \u00a9 2020 Verizon Media.

The decision follows uncertainty about when big movie theater chains in the United States will be able to reopen after being shuttered since mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic.  \"Mulan\" will cost a premium price of $29.99 on the Disney+ streaming service in the United States, Canada, Australia and parts of Western Europe, Disney's chief executive, Bob Chapek, said on a call with investors after Disney reported quarterly earnings. Reuters Regal Cinemas to reopen U.S. theaters on Aug 21 with new protocols Regal Cinemas said on Monday it plans to reopen theaters in the United States on Aug. 21, as the theater chain is counting on big-budget movies such as \"Tenet\" to help lure audiences out of their homes during the pandemic.  Movie theaters closed their doors around the world in mid-March when several countries imposed lockdowns and social distancing measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus.  \"With the health and safety of our staff, customers and communities as our top priority, we are happy to invite audiences to return to the timeless theatrical experience,\" said Chief Executive Officer Mooky Greidinger of UK's Cineworld Group Plc, which owns Regal Cinemas in the United States. Reuters Cineworld, AMC shares fall as cancelled premieres spell more pressure Chinese-controlled AMC <AMC.N>, the United States' largest chain, said on Thursday it was postponing reopenings across the country as COVID-19 cases grow at an alarming rate in some states.  Britain's Cineworld, which has also delayed the reopening of its U.S. theatres to mid-August, has reopened in Europe and plans to restart main UK operations at the end of July, but analysts worry that could be delayed and predict limited ticket sales.  Shares in Cineworld, already headed for their worst-ever yearly fall with an 80% plunge, were down 9% at 48.3 pence by 1103 GMT. Advertise With Us \u00a9 2020 Verizon Media. All rights reserved.

APT will deploy high-band 28 GHz mmWave in Taiwan to deliver the ultra-fast mobile broadband speeds expected in the 5G era.The exclusive deal will see Nokia provide a number of its AirScale Radio Access solutions. These solutions will enable APT to deliver market-leading 5G experiences to subscribers with ultra-fast data speeds, ultra-low latency, and a new level of connectivity. AirScale Radio Access is an industry-first commercial end-to-end 5G solution enabling operators to capitalize early on 5G.As part of the deal, APT will also deploy Nokia software\u00a0spanning Core Network, monetization and security. The cloud-native Cloud Mobile Gateway (CMG) and Cloud Mobility Manager (CMM) appliance solutions, from Nokia\u2019s Cloud Packet Core (CPC) portfolio, will deliver a highly scalable and flexible Control/User Plane Separation (CUPS) architecture. The CPC cloud-native design also gives APT the capability to rapidly launch 5G services to its customers without making significant changes to the network. Additional virtual network functions and applications to be deployed on Nokia CloudBand and NetAct will manage these along with the physical network elements. This will allow APT to shift its network and operations to cloud-native automated efficiency and to rapidly launch and monetize new 5G experiences and enterprise services. NetGuard Certificate Manager will, in turn, ensure efficient and secured management of digital entities. Nokia will also provide its Nokia AirFrame data center solution to support cloud-based applications necessary for future telco and IT networking and service delivery, and digital design and deployment for a faster time to market, as well as optimization and technical support services. APT plans to launch 5G services later this year and has ambitious plans to use the technology to develop Taiwan\u2019s enterprise sector as well as introduce cloud gaming, virtual reality, augmented reality and streaming services to subscribers. Nokia will support APT in meeting its ambitious targets for 5G, targeting six vertical industries: smart manufacturing, smart retail, smart medical, smart transportation, smart entertainment, and smart energy. APT secured 400MHz in the 28 GHz frequency range but not mid-band spectrum and plans to work with other operators to share network\u00a0in\u00a0the 3.5 GHz frequency range in order to offer services in both bands. Nokia is a long-standing partner of APT and provides the majority of its 4G network. \u00a0Mr. Nanren Huang, President at Asia Pacific Telecom said: \u201cAPT has ambitious targets for its 5G services, including transforming the enterprise and consumer sectors in Taiwan with new and enhanced high-speed services. We are excited to continue our long-standing relationship with Nokia as we enter the 5G era and look forward to achieving our goals with them as our partner.\u201dTommi Uitto, President of Mobile Networks at Nokia, said: \u201cThis is another important win for us in Taiwan with a long-standing partner. APT is pioneering the implementation of high-band 5G at 28 GHz mmWave in the region with Nokia as its sole supplier. We look forward to helping APT execute its strategy and deliver compelling and transformative experiences, using Nokia\u2019s end-to-end 5G solution to business and consumers alike.\u201dResources: Webpage: Nokia AirScaleWebpage: Nokia 5G RANWebpage: Nokia CoreWebpage: Nokia MonetizationWebpage: Nokia NetGuard Certificate ManagerWebpage: Nokia CloudBandWebpage: Cloud Packet CoreWebpage: Nokia NetActDid you know?

MRNA stock rose early Wednesday. MarketWatch Moderna's stock rallies as it moves forward with enrolling its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial Shares of Moderna Inc.  gained 1.9% in premarket trading on Wednesday after the company said it plans to complete enrollment for the Phase 3 trial for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in September and that it has already received $400 million in deposits in preparation of the experimental vaccine's regulatory authorization. Moderna, founded in 2010, is considered a preclinical company because it does not market any approved medical products. \"As we pivot to a commercial-stage company, we recognize the need for responsible pricing in the face of the pandemic,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a news release. Moderna is developing one of the frontrunning COVID-19 vaccines, and the orders and government funding for its candidate have shifted the company's balance sheet this year. Moderna had a loss of $116.5 million, or 31 cents per share, in the second quarter of 2020, compared with a loss of $134.9 million, or 41 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. It had revenue of $66.3 million in the quarter, up from $13.1 million in the like quarter in 2019, with the company attributing the increase to COVID-19 funding and unrelated collaboration revenue from AstraZeneca . Its general and administrative expenses were $36.6 million for the past three months, compared with $28.5 million for the same period a year ago.

The research, entitled Going from good to great, identifies the aircraft industry\u2019s structured-learning environment as one to emulate because learning from experience and errors has increased safety enormously and given birth to innovations such as checklists to improve decision-making and dashboards for tracking mission-critical issues.  \u201cThe aircraft industry ensures the safety of billions of people through learning from experience,\u201d said Roger Urwin, cofounder of the Thinking Ahead Institute. \u201cInvestment committees can likewise provide for the financial safety of billions of people by applying best-practice frameworks to their context. In doing so they will be better placed to tackle the challenges that lie ahead such as systemic risks, performance pressures, complexity management, increased regulatory influence and the growing influences from multiple stakeholders.\u201dThe research explores best-practice governance for ICs and sets out a best-practices checklist which all types of ICs can follow to improve their outcomes. For more ambitious and well-resourced organizations, it suggests the adoption of the Total Portfolio Approach (TPA) to introduce more dynamism and focus on goals when making decisions.\u201cLarge asset owners are using advanced best-practice governance to unlock the complexities of modern investment, notably when dealing with ESG considerations, and employing TPA helps the integrated thinking required. We believe that this crisis will accelerate the adoption of TPA and, in time, it will become one of the defining innovations of this period,\u201d added Urwin. \u00a0\u00a0The paper sets out 10 building blocks investment committees can use for more successful outcomes, including strategic focus, an effective chairperson and strong culture.\u201cRetaining a strategic focus is vital for effective board governance and doubly important for investment committees, where there is often a temptation to get lost in the weeds. Key to this discipline is having an effective chairperson. This leadership role is crucial in terms of setting and managing overall strategic direction, facilitating the contributions from all committee members and extracting all the benefits of a strong culture,\u201d said Urwin.The Institute suggests that taking an IC from good to great outcomes\u2014acknowledging the confines of resources and time\u2014is eminently doable with strong leadership and an ambitious strategy that identifies key areas where ICs can make the biggest gains:  * It is critical to get the right people on the IC \u2018bus\u2019, especially in the areas of competency, teamwork and accountability.  * Opportunities for improved efficiency and collective intelligence can be exploited, notably: extending the chair role; building IC teamwork; pinpointing its comparative advantages; restyling the IC process; and developing a richer culture.  * This crisis presents opportunities such as exercising more innovative thinking and practice when conducting IC meetings, and applying more innovative thinking to future challenges.\u201cCould investment committees and boards set their sights higher? Absolutely they could. The stakes are too high for them not to take this path. And these current pressurized circumstances make such steps attractive right now,\u201d said Urwin.About the Thinking Ahead InstituteThe Thinking Ahead Institute was established in January 2015 and is a global not-for-profit investment research and innovation member group made up of engaged institutional asset owners and service providers committed to mobilizing capital for a sustainable future.

Although employers expect to have significantly more remote workers in the future compared with last year, many have yet to develop policies to encourage working from home. These are among the findings from Willis Towers Watson\u2019s latest COVID-19 employer survey.  According to the survey, 55% of respondents expect most (at least three out of four) of their furloughed employees to be back at work by the first quarter of next year; however, just one in six (16%) expect to rehire most of their laid-off workers by then.\u201cOne of the myriad of challenges employers face as they begin to restore stability in a post-COVID-19 era is deciding which employees to bring back to work and when,\u201d said Ravin Jesuthasan, managing director, Willis Towers Watson. \u201cWhile those decisions will ultimately depend on public health and economic recovery, employers will also need to adapt to having a larger percentage of remote workers, and this will fundamentally change their culture.\u201dLooking ahead, employers expect that the proportion of their workforce who are full-time employees working from home (19%) will be less than half of current levels (44%) but nearly three times what it was last year (7%).Despite the expectation of a greater proportion of employees working from home, many employers have not yet taken steps to address this shift. Less than two in 10 employers (19%) have changed policies to encourage more remote work although 60% are planning or considering doing so. Only two in 10 (20%) have provided tools and resources to employees who may work remotely long term, although two-thirds (66%) are planning or considering doing so. And just one in 10 respondents (10%) have acted to offer employees subsidies to manage costs of working remotely while nearly three times as many (29%) are planning or considering doing so.Employers, however, are making changes to how work is being done because of the pandemic and its subsequent economic effects. Roughly eight in 10 employers (79%) made adjustments to reflect the new protocol while more than half (58%) adjusted to the definition of the role of the workplace and what work should be primarily done onsite versus remotely. And nearly three in 10 employers (29%) made changes to move work to different jobs.\u201cThe pandemic is forcing employers to rethink virtually every aspect of how work is being done and how to reward this work,\u201d said Catherine Hartmann, North America Rewards practice leader, Willis Towers Watson. \u201cWith many companies planning to accelerate their reliance on automation and remote workers, the focus on how work gets done will become paramount. In turn, the organizations that get in front of up-skilling, re-skilling and, in some cases, out-skilling will be best positioned coming out of the pandemic.\u201dOther survey findings include:  * Over half (52%) of employers expect most (three out of four) workers who took a pay cut or had their workweek reduced will be back to normal levels by the first quarter of 2021.  * Three in 10 employers (29%) have accelerated or adopted new special initiatives, such as technology rollouts, while nearly four in 10 (38%) have changed or are planning or considering changing where work is done to reduce supply chain risks.  * More than half of respondents believe changes they have made since the pandemic began have had a positive impact on employee wellbeing (53%) and the employee experience (51%).  * Most respondents have a sufficient budget to maintain and effectively deliver existing talent and reward programs (88%), but fewer have the budget to add critical new programs (58%) or adopt new technologies (49%).About the surveyA total of 283 employers participated in the Actions to Restore Stability Survey, which was conducted during the first half of July 2020.

The research, entitled Going from good to great, identifies the aircraft industry\u2019s structured-learning environment as one to emulate because learning from experience and errors has increased safety enormously and given birth to innovations such as checklists to improve decision-making and dashboards for tracking mission-critical issues.  \u201cThe aircraft industry ensures the safety of billions of people through learning from experience,\u201d said Roger Urwin, cofounder of the Thinking Ahead Institute. \u201cInvestment committees can likewise provide for the financial safety of billions of people by applying best-practice frameworks to their context. In doing so they will be better placed to tackle the challenges that lie ahead such as systemic risks, performance pressures, complexity management, increased regulatory influence and the growing influences from multiple stakeholders.\u201dThe research explores best-practice governance for ICs and sets out a best-practices checklist which all types of ICs can follow to improve their outcomes. For more ambitious and well-resourced organizations, it suggests the adoption of the Total Portfolio Approach (TPA) to introduce more dynamism and focus on goals when making decisions.\u201cLarge asset owners are using advanced best-practice governance to unlock the complexities of modern investment, notably when dealing with ESG considerations, and employing TPA helps the integrated thinking required. We believe that this crisis will accelerate the adoption of TPA and, in time, it will become one of the defining innovations of this period,\u201d added Urwin. \u00a0\u00a0The paper sets out 10 building blocks investment committees can use for more successful outcomes, including strategic focus, an effective chairperson and strong culture.\u201cRetaining a strategic focus is vital for effective board governance and doubly important for investment committees, where there is often a temptation to get lost in the weeds. Key to this discipline is having an effective chairperson. This leadership role is crucial in terms of setting and managing overall strategic direction, facilitating the contributions from all committee members and extracting all the benefits of a strong culture,\u201d said Urwin.The Institute suggests that taking an IC from good to great outcomes\u2014acknowledging the confines of resources and time\u2014is eminently doable with strong leadership and an ambitious strategy that identifies key areas where ICs can make the biggest gains:  * It is critical to get the right people on the IC \u2018bus\u2019, especially in the areas of competency, teamwork and accountability.  * Opportunities for improved efficiency and collective intelligence can be exploited, notably: extending the chair role; building IC teamwork; pinpointing its comparative advantages; restyling the IC process; and developing a richer culture.  * This crisis presents opportunities such as exercising more innovative thinking and practice when conducting IC meetings, and applying more innovative thinking to future challenges.\u201cCould investment committees and boards set their sights higher? Absolutely they could. The stakes are too high for them not to take this path. And these current pressurized circumstances make such steps attractive right now,\u201d said Urwin.About the Thinking Ahead InstituteThe Thinking Ahead Institute was established in January 2015 and is a global not-for-profit investment research and innovation member group made up of engaged institutional asset owners and service providers committed to mobilizing capital for a sustainable future. It has 45 members around the world and is an outgrowth of the Thinking Ahead Group which was set up in 2002.

Although employers expect to have significantly more remote workers in the future compared with last year, many have yet to develop policies to encourage working from home. These are among the findings from Willis Towers Watson\u2019s latest COVID-19 employer survey.  According to the survey, 55% of respondents expect most (at least three out of four) of their furloughed employees to be back at work by the first quarter of next year; however, just one in six (16%) expect to rehire most of their laid-off workers by then.\u201cOne of the myriad of challenges employers face as they begin to restore stability in a post-COVID-19 era is deciding which employees to bring back to work and when,\u201d said Ravin Jesuthasan, managing director, Willis Towers Watson. \u201cWhile those decisions will ultimately depend on public health and economic recovery, employers will also need to adapt to having a larger percentage of remote workers, and this will fundamentally change their culture.\u201dLooking ahead, employers expect that the proportion of their workforce who are full-time employees working from home (19%) will be less than half of current levels (44%) but nearly three times what it was last year (7%).Despite the expectation of a greater proportion of employees working from home, many employers have not yet taken steps to address this shift. Less than two in 10 employers (19%) have changed policies to encourage more remote work although 60% are planning or considering doing so. Only two in 10 (20%) have provided tools and resources to employees who may work remotely long term, although two-thirds (66%) are planning or considering doing so. And just one in 10 respondents (10%) have acted to offer employees subsidies to manage costs of working remotely while nearly three times as many (29%) are planning or considering doing so.Employers, however, are making changes to how work is being done because of the pandemic and its subsequent economic effects. Roughly eight in 10 employers (79%) made adjustments to reflect the new protocol while more than half (58%) adjusted to the definition of the role of the workplace and what work should be primarily done onsite versus remotely.

India in June outlawed 59 Chinese apps for threatening the country's \"sovereignty and integrity\", including ByteDance's video-sharing app TikTok, Alibaba's UC Browser and Xiaomi's Mi Community app. Benzinga Unusual Options Activity Insight: Baidu On Tuesday, shares of Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $125.2.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-08-21  * Strike Price: $130.00  * Volume: 1688  * Open Interest: 24073 Ways Options Activity is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume is one way options activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of shares contracts traded for a day. Contracts that have been traded, but not closed by a counter-party, are called open interest. A purchased contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for the option.When a contract has an expiration date in the distant future, it is generally another sign of unusual activity. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are \"out of the money\" are also indicative of unusual options activity. \"Out of the money\" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish and Bearish Sentiments Options are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * 16 Communication Services Stocks Moving In Tuesday's Pre-Market Session(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

Due to COVID-19, most, if not all casinos were closed for a significant period of time. Even after they re-opened, there is still concern regarding how long it will take for operations to normalize to pre-COVID-19 levels.While there\u2019s certainly a degree of risk involved, the down-trodden tickers can be the ones set to present intrepid investors with the most abundant returns. Where investing skill really comes into play, though, is finding the most compelling choices.With this in mind, we used TipRanks\u2019 database to identify three beaten-down gaming stocks that have earned a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus rating from the analyst community. Boyd Gaming (BYD)We\u2019ll start off with Boyd Gaming, which operates 29 gaming properties. The company is divided into three segments: Las Vegas Locals, Downtown Las Vegas, and Midwest and South.Operating performance in the second quarter declined considerably, with all 29 of Boyd's properties closed for most of the quarter because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue dropped 75.2% to $209.9 million, while adjusted earnings plummeted 147% to a net loss of $110.5 million, versus the second quarter of 2019. Nevertheless, despite the poor showing, the company handily beat the consensus estimates for revenue and earnings by 25.7% and 47%, respectively.5-star analyst Joseph Greff, of J.P. Morgan, commented, \u201cSecond quarter 2020 results were much better than we expected, with June generating levels of strong (and positive) EBITDAR following recent staggered property re-openings that followed widespread casino closures. Boyd, \u2026reported meaningfully lower operating expenses allowing it to generate impressive year-over-year margin gains (1,000 bps+, wow)\u2026\u201dThe company\u2019s stock is down 16% year-to-date. However, Greff predicts a rebound for Boyd based on its \u201clocalized/regional footprint predominantly focused on a drive-to, leisure gaming customer.\u201d The company has an advantage over other gaming companies because it is less dependent on the travel and tourism industry.According to the J.P. Morgan analyst, there is another catalyst that could propel the stock forward. \u201cFurthermore, we see Boyd as a non-conventional way to play growth in U.S. sports betting, and note that its 5% stake in FanDuel is largely unappreciated/overlooked by investors,\u201d he explained.Based on all of the above, Greff rates Boyd an Overweight (i.e. Buy), along with a $30 price target, which adds up to upside potential of 21% from the current share price. (To watch Greff\u2019s track record, click here)Similarly, most of the Street is getting onboard. 8 Buys and 2 Hold assigned in the last three months add up to a Strong Buy analyst consensus. In addition, the $27.50 average price target puts the potential upside at 10.5%. (See Boyd stock analysis on TipRanks)Las Vegas Sands (LVS)Next on our list is Las Vegas Sands, the largest gaming company in the world, with a market cap of over $33 billion. The company operates gaming resorts in Asia and the United States. Besides gaming, its resorts feature entertainment, retail malls, restaurants and convention and exhibition facilities.Consistent with the severe challenges the gaming industry has experienced, the pandemic had a devastating impact on the company in Q2. Revenue plunged 97.1% to $98 million, while LVS posted a net loss of $985 million, compared to net income of $1.11 billion in the prior-year quarter. Similarly, the stock has declined 35% year-to-date.Howevere, Roth Capital analyst David Bain believes LVS is well positioned with \u201cpeer-best liquidity (could survive 18-months in zero revenue environment while still executing Macau and Singapore development projects), while longer-term large new project/M&A optionality remains strong.\u201dAs a result of its strong liquidity, Bain is taking a long-term approach to the stock. \u201cLonger-term investors should be rewarded significantly due long-term Macau structural advantages, mainly its peer-high hotel base and duopoly position in Singapore,\u201d he stated.Accordingly, the four-star analyst rates LVS a Buy and sets a price target of $52, which means there\u2019s upside potential of 19%. (To watch Bain\u2019s track record, click here)Overall, LVS gets a Strong Buy consensus rating from the analyst community. This is based on 8 Buy ratings and 2 Holds. The average price target is $56.50, which is more optimistic than Bain\u2019s, and suggests upside potential of 29%. (See LVS stock analysis on TipRanks)Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO)Rounding out our list is Melco Resorts & Entertainment, which operates high-end integrated gaming and entertainment resorts in Asia and Europe.The company has yet to announce second-quarter results. The consensus estimates, which are consistent with those for the rest of the casino industry, are disappointing to say the least. Revenue is expected to fall 81.4% to $268.94 million, and earnings are set to sink 562.5% to a loss of $1.11 per share. No surprise, the stock is down 30% year-to-date.Despite all of the doom and gloom, Roth Capital analyst David Bain, who also covers LVS, is bullish on the stock. \u201cThe combination of MLCO\u2019s valuation, player segment positioning, HK/China Headquarters (hedging concession renewals) \u2026, positions it as the best \u2018Macau stock\u2019 to own,\u201d he commented.Given the challenging times, the company has taken steps to prop up its balance sheet.

But thanks to our unique offer combining seamlessly creative, media, data and technology, to our unmatched backbone of shared services and our strong balance sheet, we have been able to reduce its impact. Our reported net revenue was up 9.7% in H1 with the contribution of Epsilon. Our organic growth in H1 came at -8.0% with Q2 at -13.0%, significantly better than the 23% decline in Global advertising expenditures predicted by Zenith and the 30% mentioned by WFA for Q2. US organic growth was only down by -3.3% in H1, with Q2 at -6.8%, when ad spend is expected to decline by 18%. Our creative and media activities were still positive at the end of May. Europe posted an organic growth of -23.5% in Q2, as the lockdowns impacted most of the second quarter. In Asia, the performance was at -5.7% in Q2, with China clearly improving from Q1 but remaining negative and volatile.Thanks to our ability to adapt fast, our country-model and our strong culture in managing costs, the Groupe demonstrated financial resilience in the first half, with an operating margin rate at 13.0%, despite the sudden drop in net revenue since March.At the same time, we continued to record significant wins in new business across the world, such as Sephora in North America, McDonald\u2019s in China, or Fran\u00e7aise des Jeux in France, demonstrating our ability to continue to win large pitches with our unique model.There is no doubt that we will all have to live with the virus and its economic and social consequences for a while, but Publicis is well armed to weather this crisis.First, we have the products and services that our clients need. Over the last few weeks, we have seen an increased demand for all the capabilities that drove our strategy in the last few years: first-party data, breakthrough creativity, digital-first media and technology. The crisis has clearly accelerated the relevance of our go-to-market. We are uniquely positioned to help our clients take back control over their customer relationship, deliver personalized experiences at scale and reduce their cost while increasing their sales.Second, in a world where our structure needs to be flatter, agile and remote, we are now truly operating as a platform. Our shared service organization has proven its efficiency and we have finalized the implementation of our country model. This enabled us to react faster and immediately answer all our client needs in a seamless way. With the global roll-out of Marcel, 60,000 of our talents around the world now have a unique way to share their expertise, learn, collaborate, and contribute to client assignments.Last but not least, we have a very solid financial backbone and a strong liquidity position that will get us through these uncertain times.As we head into the second half, we are focusing on limiting the impact of the downturn, accelerating our new offering for our clients, while continuing to adapt our cost structure.I would like to thank all of our clients for their trust as well as the Publicis\u2019 teams around the world. They are our most precious asset and the ones who will drive our clients\u2019 and our own future success. They have demonstrated outstanding commitment, solidarity, dedication and resilience despite the challenges they have endured, professionally and personally, during the lockdown. \u00bb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Publicis Groupe\u2019s Supervisory Board met on July 22, 2020, under the chairmanship of Maurice L\u00e9vy, to examine the 2020 first semester accounts presented by Arthur Sadoun, CEO and Chairman of the Management Board.KEY FIGURESEUR million, except per-share data and percentages H1 2020 H1 2019 2020   vs 2019  Data from the Income Statement and Cash flow Statement \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0   Net revenue  4,774  4,352  +9.7%   Pass-through revenue  504  516  -2.3%   Revenue  5,278  4,868  +8.4%   EBITDA  923  885  +4.3%   % of Net revenue 19.3% 20.3% -100 bps  Operating margin excluding transaction costs (1) 622  652  -4.6%   % of Net revenue 13.0% 15.0% -200 bps  Operating margin  622  612  +1.6%   % of Net revenue 13.0% 14.1% -110 bps  Operating income  254  489  -48.1%   Net income attributable to the Groupe  136  345  -60.6%   Earnings Per Share (EPS)  0.57  1.49  -61.7%   Headline diluted EPS (2) 1.75  1.98  -11.6%   Free Cash Flow before change in working capital requirements  495  491  +0.8%   Data from the Balance Sheet June 30, 2020 Dec. 31, 2019     \u00a0   Total assets  29,624  32,659  \u00a0   Groupe share of Shareholders\u2019 equity  7,030  7,401  \u00a0   Net debt (net cash)  3,221  2,713  \u00a0     \u00a0(1) Transaction costs related to the acquisition of Epsilon totaled 40 million euros in 2019\u00a0(2) Net income attributable to the Groupe, after elimination of impairment charges, amortization of intangibles arising on acquisitions, the main capital gains (or losses) on disposals, change in the fair value of financial assets, the revaluation of earn-out costs and Epsilon transaction costs, divided by the average number of shares on a diluted basis  NET REVENUE IN H1 2020Publicis Groupe\u2019s net revenue for the first half 2020 was 4,774 million euros, up by 9.7% compared to 4,352 million euros in H1 2019. Exchange rate variations over the period have a positive impact of 32 million euros. Acquisitions (net of disposals) have a contribution of 743 million euros on net revenue, most of it being related to the acquisition of Epsilon.Organic growth is -8.0% in H1 2020. The Groupe has been impacted by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic from March, with a further decline in organic growth in Q2 following the containment measures that were implemented by governments in different geographies. With its transformation almost completed, the Groupe entered well the year 2020 thanks to its strong tailwind in the US and its continued new business momentum. Breakdown of H1 2020 net revenue by sector    Based on 3,285 clients representing 91% of the Groupe\u2019s net revenue.

Excluding the impact of French activities that were shut down in Q2, like our outdoor media operations and the Drugstore, the organic growth in Europe is -12.9%. The performance varied per country, as it reflects different activity mix and local economic situations. It was also impacted in Q2 by the different containment measures that were decided by governments in the main countries of the region. In H1, organic decline was -14.0% in the UK and -17.1%2 in France. In Germany, organic growth was down -5.3%, also suffering from the lockdown but benefitting from 2019 new business wins in the country.Net revenue in North America is up by +30.1% in H1, including the positive impact of the Epsilon acquisition. On an organic basis, the region posted a decline in net revenue of -3.6% in H1. The performance was resilient, notably in the US (-3.3%), where the Groupe benefitted from a strong start to the year for all its activities.Asia Pacific net revenue was down by -2.3% on a reported basis and down by -3.9% on an organic basis. China reported an organic growth of -10.2%, Australia was down by -5.4% on an organic basis, while India and Singapore grew respectively by +3.6% and +1.5% on an organic basis.Net revenue in Latin America was down by -27.8% on a reported basis, with a significant negative impact from currencies in the region, especially in Brazil. On an organic basis, the decline was -15.7%. This is mostly due to an organic decline of -22.8% in Brazil and of -14.4% in Mexico.Net revenue in the Middle East and Africa region was down by -11.2% on a reported basis, and -11.8% on an organic basis.NET REVENUE IN Q2 2020Publicis Groupe's net revenue in Q2 2020 was 2,293 million euros compared to 2,234 million euros in Q2 2019, up by 2.6%. Exchange rate variations had a 1 million euros negative impact. The acquisitions (net of disposals) contributed 350 million euros to net revenue in Q2 2020, mainly reflecting the contribution of Epsilon.Organic growth was -13.0% in Q2 2020. Excluding the impact of French activities that were shut down during Q2, like outdoor media activities and the Drugstore, organic growth for the Groupe was -11.0%. Most of Groupe\u2019s activities were negatively impacted in Q2, except the Health division which recorded a double-digit growth. Europe was particularly affected as containment measures lasted over the vast majority of the quarter. Breakdown of Q2 2020 Net revenue by regionEUR  Net revenue Reported Organic  million Q2 2020 Q2 2019 growth growth  Europe  510  663  -23.1%  -23.5%   North America  1,458  1,177  +23.9%  -7.6%   Asia Pacific  215  237  -9.3%  -5.7%   Latin America  50  78  -35.9%  -20.2%   Middle East & Africa  60  79  -24.1%  -23.5%   Total 2,293 2,234 +2.6% -13.0%      ANALYSIS OF H1 2020 KEY FIGURESIncome StatementEBITDA amounted to 923 million euros in H1 2020, compared to 885 million euros in H1 2019, up by 4.3%, including the contribution of Epsilon. The impact of the cost reduction plan announced in April was 286 million euros in H1, on a comparable basis and excluding Epsilon acquisition costs. This translates into a margin rate of 19.3% of net revenue (compared to 20.3% in H1 2019).  * Personnel costs totaled 3,224 million euros at June 30, 2020, up by 12.0% from 2,879 million euros in H1 2019. This evolution reflects the integration of Epsilon during H1, as well as the continued investment in the Groupe\u2019s transformation. This was partly offset by the impact of the first measures of the cost reduction plan. As a percentage of net revenue, the personnel expenses represented 67.5% in H1 2020, compared to 66.1% in H1 2019. Fixed personnel costs were 2,862 million euros represented 59.9% of net revenue versus 57.7% in H1 2019. On a comparable basis, fixed personnel costs declined by 61 million euros year-on-year, thanks to the actions taken by the Groupe, as hiring freeze, pause in internal promotions, shorter work week or voluntary salary cuts. Moreover, the Groupe decided to limit the use of freelancers. As a result, the cost of freelancers declined by 43 million euros in H1 2020 on a comparable basis, representing 141 million euros. Restructuring costs reached 69 million euros (61 million euros in H1 2019), reflecting additional charges related to the cost reduction plan.   \u00a0  * Other operating expenses (excluding depreciation & amortization) amounted to 1,131 million euros, compared to 1,104 million euros in H1 2019. This represents 23.7% of net revenue compared to 25.4% in H1 2019, implying that the cost reduction measures more than offset the negative impact of Epsilon cost structure on this ratio. The Groupe was able to make significant savings on other operating expenses in H1 2020, thanks to the actions taken as part of the cost reduction plan, and thanks to some expenses that drastically reduced during the lockdowns. This was notably the case with travel restrictions, which mechanically reduced the travel, recruitment and seminar related expenses.Depreciation and amortization charge was 301 million euros in H1 2020, up by 10.3% compared to H1 2019. The increase is largely due to the consolidation of Epsilon over the period.The operating margin amounted to 622 million euros, up by 1.6% compared to H1 2019. This represents a margin rate of 13.0%, down by 110 basis points from 14.1% in H1 201. When compared to the H1 2019 margin excluding Epsilon acquisition costs, the margin declined by 200 basis points. This decrease is due to the decline in organic growth related to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, partially offset by a 6.4% reduction in the cost base.Operating margin rates by major geographic areas reflected the various challenges faced by the different regions in H1 2020, in the context of the global pandemic. It was 1.8% in Europe, 16.4% in North America, 22.5% in Asia-Pacific, 5.7% in Latin America and 3.0% in the Africa / Middle East region.Amortization of intangibles arising from acquisitions totaled 142 million euro in H1 2020, up from 27 million euro in H1 2019. This increase is mainly due to the amortization from July 1st 2019 of new intangibles arising from Epsilon acquisition and the amortization of tradenames arising from acquisition. Starting from July 1st, 2019 tradenames are amortized, following the implementation of our country-model organization. Impairment losses amounted to 231 million euros, and are exclusively related to the real estate consolidation plan \"All in One\", which leads to a reduction in the number of sites, while allowing better collaboration between the teams. In H1 2019, impairment losses were 113 million euros (of which 90 million euros related to real estate plan \u201cAll in One\u201d). In addition, net non-current income is positive at 5 million euros H1 2020, compared to an income of 17 million euros in H1 2019.Operating income totaled 254 million euro in H1 2020, after 489 million euro in H1 2019.The financial result, comprising the cost of net financial debt and other financial charges and income, is an expense of 92 million euros in H1 2020 compared to an expense of 1 million euros last year. The net expense on net financial debt was 48 million euros in H1 2020, including a 51 million euros interest charge related to Epsilon\u2019s acquisition debt. Last year, it was a net income of 15 million euros. Other financial income and expenses were a charge of 44 million euros in H1 2020, notably composed by 40 million euros interest on lease liabilities. Other financial income and expenses were a charge of 16 million euros in H1 2019, including 30 million euros of interest on lease obligations and 19 million in income from the fair value remeasurement of Mutual Funds.The revaluation of earn-out payments amounted to a profit of 2 million euros at end-June, compared to a charge of 1 million in H1 2019.The tax charge is 39 million euros, corresponding to a forecast effective tax rate of 25.0% in 2020, compared to 136 million euros in H1 2019, corresponding to a forecast effective tax rate of 25.8% in 2019.The share in the profit of associates is a loss of 2 million euros, compared to a loss of 5 million euros in H1 2019. Minority interests were an income of 13 million euros in Groupe results in H1 2020 compared to a loss of 1 million in the previous year.Overall, net income attributable to the Groupe was 136 million euros at June 30, 2020, compared to 345\u00a0million euro at June 30, 2019.Free Cash FlowEUR million H1 2020 H1 2019  EBITDA  923  885   Financial interest paid (net)  (81)  33   Repayment of lease liabilities and related interests  (234)  (214)   Tax paid  (74)  (190)   Other  34  42   Cash Flow from operations before change in WCR 568 556  Investments in fixed assets (net)  (73)  (65)   Free cash-flow before changes in WCR 495 491    The Groupe\u2019s free cash flow, before change in working capital requirements, is slightly up by 0.8% compared to H1 2019, at 495 million euros. Financial interest paid mostly include interests on the acquisition debt of Epsilon. Tax paid amounted to 74 million euros, down compared to 190 million euros in H1 2019, related to agreed postponements for tax payment in some countries in H1 2020. The increase in net investments in fixed assets is mostly related to Epsilon. The Groupe is very selective regarding its investment policy, favouring IT spending especially to support work from home initiatives that have been implemented in Q2.Net debtNet financial debt amounted to 3,221 million euros as of June 30, 2020 compared to 2,713 million euros as of December 31, 2019. The Groupe's average net debt in H1 2020 amounted to 3,684 million euros compared to 550 million euros in H1 2019. The increase in average net debt reflects the financing linked to the acquisition of Epsilon, for 4.5 billion dollars.

Following the UK launch earlier in the year, Marcel rolled out in the US in April, with 90% of the employees who have adopted the platform in the US in less than a month.\u00a0 Marcel was launched in other markets around the world in the weeks that followed, with 60,000 Publicis Groupe employees now connected through the platform. All of Publicis\u2019 talents around the world now have a unique\u00a0way\u00a0to share their expertise, learn, collaborate, and contribute to client assignments. Among its features, Marcel is the exclusive destination for available opportunities within the company also offering \u201cgigs\u201d- short-term projects, where employees who want to do more can raise their hand to contribute, matching skills and bandwidth with need, and delivering a true distributed, borderless workforce. Marcel is\u00a0becoming\u00a0central\u00a0in\u00a0our ability to allocate resource for clients and new business within the Groupe, train our talent for this new world, communicate and sometimes celebrate. Marcel allowed Publicis to virtually host its Cannes-Do Awards last month, ensuring the company continued to spotlight and celebrate creativity even in a year when most awards shows cancelled. Through Marcel, the company garnered 1,400 award submissions from all parts of the company and world, from which 10 client campaigns and five non-profit campaigns were selected winners via 15,000 employee votes through the platform and a panel of judges, and the ceremony livestreamed exclusively on Marcel.    In addition, Marcel enabled the company to come together in new ways. Pausing for Action, hosted on Marcel June 17, brought together 18,000 employees for a day of listening, learning and ideating how to move forward the Publicis Groupe diversity and inclusion mandate. Through the platform, the company virtually presented six hours of content spanning speakers, three learning tracks, plus \u201copen briefs\u201d in which 7,300 employees engaged to shape the future of the Groupe\u2019s efforts. DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIONGuided by the input of the company\u2019s US workforce during Pausing for Action, Publicis Groupe committed to seven focused actions for the U.S., with ongoing measurement and accountability to drive diversity and inclusion. These actions include: publishing and monitoring workforce data; cultivating the careers of Black talent; designing a recruitment, interview and onboard experience that champions Black talent; building strong ally-ship culture with mandatory \u201cdisrupting everyday bias training;\u201d \u20ac45M investment over three years on Diversity, Inclusion and Social Justice; launch Open Apprenticeship on Marcel to serve minority youth who typically do not have access to the industry; and create the Diversity Progress Council, comprised of internal members, key clients and external representation, to measure progress and evaluate actions on an ongoing basis, with the first meeting taking place in September. As part of commitment to publishing U.S. workforce data, the Groupe released its first diversity numbers on July 1, importantly doing so in a way that provided the transparency that the U.S. market requires to drive and measure change. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS   There were no significant transaction on the period.OUTLOOKThe full impact of the current crisis on the economy remains largely unknown. This creates uncertainties which make it difficult to provide any specific guidance for the second half of 2020.When it comes to net revenue, Q2 could be the low point, but it is premature to say whether the second half will be better or worse than the first half, as some sectors but also some countries will recover faster than others, and clients will react differently.The operating margin rate will be higher in H2 than in H1, taking into account that several factors will have a negative impact: as countries reopen, some of the operating expenses will resume, and the Groupe will continue to invest in its model.Heading into the second half, the Groupe is committed to limit the impact of client cuts, accelerate its new offering and continue to adapt its cost base to the evolution of revenue. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *  DisclaimerCertain information contained in this document, other than historical information, may constitute forward-looking statements or unaudited financial forecasts.\u00a0 These forward-looking statements and forecasts are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.

Bloomberg The World\u2019s Jumbo Jets Are Heading for the Boneyard (Bloomberg Opinion) -- The queens of the skies have fallen on hard times.As Covid-19 has frozen the international travel on which they once thrived, double-decker, four-engine\u00a0planes like the Airbus SE A380 and Boeing Co. 747 are more likely to be found in storage than soaring through the skies.Carriers such as Pan Am Corp. used the 747 to turn aviation into a global industry in the 1970s, and over the past decade Emirates used the A380 to repeat the trick for the global south \u2014\u00a0but\u00a0those times have passed.\u00a0Since mid-March, most have barely flown except on short hops\u00a0to maintain pilots\u2019 certifications\u00a0and valedictory voyages to gather dust in desert boneyards.Many of those furloughs look like becoming permanent. IAG SA\u2019s British Airways has\u00a0announced plans to ground the largest\u00a0fleet of 747-400s for good. Qantas Airways Ltd. sent its last 747\u00a0home to the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0last week, and has already suspended its stable\u00a0of A380s.Among\u00a0the 15 operators of the A380, which entered service less than 13 years ago, only\u00a0Emirates has been operating flights in anything close to a normal fashion, according to data from aircraft-tracking site Flightradar24. Out of its 115 such planes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0about half the global fleet \u2014 just a dozen\u00a0have been flying to and from Europe over the past month or so, as limited traffic has trickled back.\u00a0China Southern Airlines Co. has also been running a limited service with its five A380s.However, the vast majority of the planes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0worth some $50 billion, if valued at about half of their list prices \u2014\u00a0have been stuck on the tarmac, possibly permanently. Qatar Airways QCSC has speculated that its A380s\u00a0may never return, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG has made similar noises.By the time the long-haul routes for which the A380 was designed return to normal in 2024 or so, about half the fleet will be at least a decade old and well on the way toward\u00a0retirement. Singapore Airlines Ltd., the biggest operator after Emirates, said in first-quarter results that it may write down \u201colder generation aircraft\u201d such as its A380s by around $1 billion.It\u2019s a similar picture with the 747. Of the 29 planes\u00a0operated by Lufthansa\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the largest passenger fleet, once British Airways\u2019 jets have retired \u2014\u00a0just four have remained in regular operation since March, with a further four gradually returning to service over the past two months.Probably the most active operator of passenger 747s at this point is Aeroflot PJSC\u2019s Rossiya Airlines, plus a handful of charter operators that run seasonal flights to holiday destinations and pilgrimage services to Saudi Arabia. Even there, though, foreign pilgrims at this year\u2019s hajj will be confined to 10,000 people already in the country.The reasons for the decline of these jets aren\u2019t hard to discern. Even at the best of times, it can be challenging to fill\u00a0more than 400 seats at a time, and a plane with more than 20% of seats empty will typically lose money \u2014\u00a0and that\u2019s before you start thinking about the costs of providing crew and destination accommodation for such vast aircraft.With the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 able to achieve similar ranges using just two engines and smaller cabins, the economics of double-decker planes no longer make a lot of sense.U.S. airlines\u00a0in particular have long since given up on the jumbo. They never bought a single A380, and last took delivery of a 747 a few months after the Sept.\u00a011, 2001, attacks, when Northwest Airlines Corp. bought two before later going bankrupt and being taken over\u00a0by Delta Air Lines Inc.There\u2019s one area that\u2019s been booming, however: freight. Air cargo typically takes up a substantial share of the belly space on passenger flights, but with borders closed to tourism, the semiconductors, high-value materials and consumer goods that typically travel beneath your feet have had to find a new route to market. Cargo traffic this year will be down just 17% from a year earlier, compared to 55%\u00a0for passenger flights, according to the International Air Transport Association.That could provide a final chapter for the 747\u00a0\u2014\u00a0although not for the A380, which isn\u2019t easily converted to cargo usage. Boeing\u2019s jumbo\u00a0is already a freight aircraft in all but name, with about two-thirds of the latest 747-800 variant being sold to freight\u00a0carriers such as United Parcel Service Inc. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd.\u2019s logistics arm. Even non-cargo aircraft can get in on the act: KLM has been carrying face masks and protective gowns\u00a0on the seats of ordinary passenger aircraft pressed into pandemic freight service.That would be an appropriate end for grand planes often likened to ocean liners. Some of the most celebrated ships of the great age of sea transport ended their lives as coal hulks, quarantine centers\u00a0and floating museums after aircraft\u00a0rendered them obsolete. The ultimate fate of jumbo jets may be\u00a0similarly prosaic: As\u00a0workaday aircraft, shipping goods to a more home-bound global population.\u00a0This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering commodities, as well as industrial and consumer companies.
