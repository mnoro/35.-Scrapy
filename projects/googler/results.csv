The multi-brand car and truck maker predicted a significant decline in full-year sales, even though it said it was seeing a gradual recovery globally as lockdowns eased. The company said its 2020 operating profit, before and including special items, would be severely down on the year before, albeit in positive territory. The company posted an adjusted operating loss of 1.7 billion euros (1.5 billion pounds) in the April to June period, down from a 5.1 billion euro adjusted operating profit in the year-earlier period. Juergen Pieper, automotive analyst at Metzler Bank said the results were below expectations. ""Revenue and operating profit are disappointing, so is the performance of VW and Audi. The outlook for the year is however encouraging, given the gradual sales recovery,"" said Pieper, who retains a ""buy"" rating on Volkswagen. Volkswagen cut its dividend proposal for 2019 to 4.80 euros per ordinary share and 4.86 euros per preferred share from a previously targeted 6.50 euros per ordinary share and 6.56 euros per preferred share. Its shares were down 5.1% at 130.58 euros a share, underperforming Germany's blue-chip DAX index which was down 1.8%. BENTLEY, BUGATTI Volkswagen, like most of its peers, has been bit hard by a drop in demand caused by the pandemic, which has led to restrictions on movement, economic crises and swathes of job losses globally. One earnings outlier, however, has been French rival PSA Group which delivered a second-quarter profit on Wednesday and reiterated its goal of achieving margins of over 4.5% in its automotive unit this year, even though these were down to 3.7% in the first half. PSA has been more aggressive about restructuring its operations, and pared down the variety of vehicles it offers and withdrawn from some markets where it does not command a significant market share even before the pandemic. Volkswagen said the adjusted operating return on sales in its automotive division fell to minus 9.1%, down from 8% in the year-earlier period, weighed down by charges to cover potential diesel risks. The group is reviewing its corporate structure but there are currently no new plans to explore divestments or listings, according to Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter, who said that all 12 brands, which include Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche and Audi, are still core to the business.

The action concerns alleged use of so-called ""defeat devices"" to mask vehicles' diesel pollution output. Engines used by Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep, as well as CNH's Iveco trucks are the focus of the probe. UK authorities have also asked two firms in London to provide documents. Fiat-Chrysler Automobile (FCA) and CNH Industrial (CNH) are both controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family. Lawsuit alleges defeat devices in Nissan petrol cars Volkswagen loses landmark German 'dieselgate' case A statement from Eurojust, a European Union agency for criminal cooperation across member states, said the probe is looking into a ""number of people"" who may have been involved in allegedly allowing use of the devices. It did not name them. The raids, initiated by German prosecutors investigating emissions fraud, involve claims that defeat devices were used in engine management software in 200,000 vehicles. Use of software to flatter emissions levels hit the headlines over the Volkswagen ""diselegate"" affair. Defeat devices allow engines to meet pollution levels under laboratory tests, but shut down the emissions control system in real-world driving conditions. UK documents Eurojust did not name the companies raided. However, FCA and CNH issued similar statements, acknowledging that investigators had turned up at several offices in Europe, and that they are cooperating fully with authorities. Eurojust also said that ""UK authorities have ordered two companies in London to produce relevant documents"". Again, these companies were not named. The statement said: ""Defeat devices are illegal according to the European Union regulations in place. Vehicles with defeat devices are not approved for road usage in the EU and consumers with such devices installed in their cars face possible driving bans."" Wednesday's raids were at three offices in Germany, in Baden-Württemberg and Hesse, three locations in the Piedmont region of Italy, and one location in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. The VW dieselgate scandal broke in 2015, since when Europe's biggest carmaker has paid out €30bn (£27bn) in fines and been investigated by regulators across the world. In the UK, motorists are involved in legal action for compensation . But VW is far from the only manufacture caught in claims about defeat devices. Nissan, Ford, and Daimler are among many firms whose true emissions levels have been challenged.

The company sold 35% fewer cars and cut back its proposed dividend but said it had been able to safeguard its cash reserves and would make an operating profit for the full year. The loss compared to a profit of 4.1 billion euro (£3.71 billion) in the same April-June quarter last year. The company said the main reason for its lower profits was the sharp fall in customer demand. Chief financial officer Frank Witter said that “the first half of 2020 was one of the most challenging in the history of our company due to the Covid-19 pandemic”. He said: “At the same time, we introduced comprehensive measures aimed at reducing costs and securing liquidity early on, which enabled us to limit the impact of the pandemic on our business to a certain degree.” The company said that the deliveries gap compared to last year was now narrowing each month, from being down 45% in April to 18% lower in June. It expects the drop to shrink to single digits in July. It said it was able to expand its global share of the car market as the overall market contracted even more than the company’s sales. Net liquidity in the automotive division increased in the quarter to 18.7 billion euro (£16.91 billion) due to measures taken to preserve cash and the placement of hybrid notes amounting to 3 billion euro (£2.71 billion). The company also amended its 2019 dividend proposal to 4.80 euro per ordinary share from 6.50 euro per ordinary share. The cutback will enable the company to transfer 855 million euro (£773 million) in retained profits to 2020’s accounts. Volkswagen said operating profits for 2020 would be “severely lower” than last year but “in positive territory”. Based in Wolfsburg, Germany, Volkswagen Group’s brands also include SEAT, Skoda, Audi, Lamborghini, and Porsche. Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

The multi-brand car and truck maker predicted a significant decline in full-year sales, even though it said it was seeing a gradual recovery globally as lockdowns eased. The company said its 2020 operating profit, before and including special items, would be severely down on the year before, albeit in positive territory. The company posted an adjusted operating loss of 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in the April to June period, down from a 5.1 billion euro adjusted operating profit in the year-earlier period. Juergen Pieper, automotive analyst at Metzler Bank said the results were below expectations. ""Revenue and operating profit are disappointing, so is the performance of VW and Audi. The outlook for the year is however encouraging, given the gradual sales recovery,"" said Pieper, who retains a ""buy"" rating on Volkswagen. Volkswagen cut its dividend proposal for 2019 to 4.80 euros per ordinary share and 4.86 euros per preferred share from a previously targeted 6.50 euros per ordinary share and 6.56 euros per preferred share. Its shares were down 5.1% at 130.58 euros a share, underperforming Germany's blue-chip DAX index which was down 1.8%. BENTLEY, BUGATTI Volkswagen, like most of its peers, has been bit hard by a drop in demand caused by the pandemic, which has led to restrictions on movement, economic crises and swathes of job losses globally. One earnings outlier, however, has been French rival PSA Group which delivered a second-quarter profit on Wednesday and reiterated its goal of achieving margins of over 4.5% in its automotive unit this year, even though these were down to 3.7% in the first half. PSA has been more aggressive about restructuring its operations, and pared down the variety of vehicles it offers and withdrawn from some markets where it does not command a significant market share even before the pandemic. Volkswagen said the adjusted operating return on sales in its automotive division fell to minus 9.1%, down from 8% in the year-earlier period, weighed down by charges to cover potential diesel risks. The group is reviewing its corporate structure but there are currently no new plans to explore divestments or listings, according to Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter, who said that all 12 brands, which include Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche and Audi, are still core to the business.

Despite the fact we are still far from beating the COVID-19 pandemic, the automakers are increasing their capital spending on the EV segment.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Fiat Chrysler delivered a loss of $1.24 billion during the second quarter, which marks a drop of 232% compared to last year's result. But its Stellantis chapter is set to change its circumstances. After its merger with Groupe PSA, Peugeot's maker (OTC: PUGOY), it will revamp its Warren Truck plant, just outside Detroit, to build the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Once completed, it will add a new product to its Jeep line - a three-row SUV capable of going where there are no roads. FCA is confident it can meet the challenge posed by Ford's new line of Broncos.But Ford's new offering does not have a three-row vehicle. And after the merger, FCAU is set to become the world's fourth largest automaker.Ford Ford's Bronco reboot was unveiled last month, after supposedly receiving 100,000 reservations for the two new models. Also, there is the redesigned Ford F-150 that has been postponed fourth quarter. Ford's Chief Financial Officer, Tim Stone, announced an expected profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter. However, he also warned that the launches of the redesigned F-150, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E will result in the company being in the red during the fourth quarter.But the bottom line is that Ford is poised to be in a much better position for 2021 as several new products will be available for sale. Moreover, Ford recently delivered an unexpected profit of $1.1. billion for its second quarter. But it was due to a one-time $3.5 billion gain on its investment with self-driving software Argo AI, recorded on its statement of financial position as a ""special item,"" as otherwise Ford would have delivered a loss like in the first quarter. Its better-than-expected results were attributed to an efficient operational execution that involved a safe restart of its plants while reducing costs, while its efforts were complemented by a favorable pricing environment.General Motors General Motors also announced that it will boost the production of full-size pickup trucks by 1,000 units per month at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant by expanding its workforce. According to its Chief Financial Officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, GM is at the end of a sweeping change in its truck portfolio. The down time in the last three years is behind GM as this will be its new bright spot. But the giant also left its first quarter profit begin as it swung to an $800 million loss in the second quarter and burned $7.8 billion in cash.Trucks In The Age Of Renewables Overall, there are many developments that pickup truck owners and fans can rejoice in. Moreover, there are many new products to look forward to such as Worksport's product line of solar powered tonneau covers for pickup trucks. Worksport (OTC: WKSP) and its three new technologically advanced light truck tonneau covers will be launched in the U.S very soon. Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling pickup truck for more than four decades. But considering these developments, that may no longer be the case.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

The multi-brand car and truck maker predicted a significant decline in full-year sales, even though it said it was seeing a gradual recovery globally as lockdowns eased. The company said its 2020 operating profit, before and including special items, would be severely down on the year before, albeit in positive territory. The company posted an adjusted operating loss of 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in the April to June period, down from a 5.1 billion euro adjusted operating profit in the year-earlier period. Juergen Pieper, automotive analyst at Metzler Bank said the results were below expectations. ""Revenue and operating profit are disappointing, so is the performance of VW and Audi. The outlook for the year is however encouraging, given the gradual sales recovery,"" said Pieper, who retains a ""buy"" rating on Volkswagen. Volkswagen cut its dividend proposal for 2019 to 4.80 euros per ordinary share and 4.86 euros per preferred share from a previously targeted 6.50 euros per ordinary share and 6.56 euros per preferred share. Its shares were down 5.1% at 130.58 euros a share, underperforming Germany's blue-chip DAX index which was down 1.8%. BENTLEY, BUGATTI Volkswagen, like most of its peers, has been bit hard by a drop in demand caused by the pandemic, which has led to restrictions on movement, economic crises and swathes of job losses globally. One earnings outlier, however, has been French rival PSA Group <PEUP.PA> which delivered a second-quarter profit on Wednesday and reiterated its goal of achieving margins of over 4.5% in its automotive unit this year, even though these were down to 3.7% in the first half. PSA has been more aggressive about restructuring its operations, and pared down the variety of vehicles it offers and withdrawn from some markets where it does not command a significant market share even before the pandemic. Volkswagen said the adjusted operating return on sales in its automotive division fell to minus 9.1%, down from 8% in the year-earlier period, weighed down by charges to cover potential diesel risks. The group is reviewing its corporate structure but there are currently no new plans to explore divestments or listings, according to Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter, who said that all 12 brands, which include Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche and Audi, are still core to the business.
