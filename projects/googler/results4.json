The index, which measures the currency's performance against a basket of six major peers, fell as low as 93.48 on July 27, down 1% from its July 24 close and its first dip below 94 since September 2018. It was the index's lowest point since June 2018. The currency's path downward is expected to continue. \"The bar for any reversal in the dollar decline seems to be set rather high,\" Chris Turner, global head of markets with ING, wrote in a July 27 note. \"The market is grappling with a U.S. dollar that is breaking down amidst rising concerns that the economic recovery is flattening out at ... new, lower levels of overall economic activity,\" Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist with JonesTrading, wrote in an email. A prolonged period of economic underperformance would all but guarantee continued Fed interest rates near zero, putting downward pressure on the dollar. Uncertainty around the path of U.S. stimulus efforts is \"reinforcing the negative sentiment for the dollar\" as disagreement within Congress and from the Trump administration undermines the prospects for a recovery in economic activity, said Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG Bank. \"The U.S. dollar is likely to remain under selling pressure until we have greater clarity on the policy support front,\" Halpenny wrote in a July 27 note. Congressional Republicans plan to unveil a $1 trillion economic recovery package later July 27, and it is expected to include additional $200-per-week payments for jobless Americans, down from the $600 payments set to expire at the end of July, according to The New York Times . The package is seen as a starting point for negotiations with Democrats, who passed a $3 trillion package in the House in May. Even if agreed to by Democrats, the proposed stimulus package may do little to boost the U.S. dollar since it \"won't be nearly as powerful\" as previous packages, O'Rourke said. Geopolitical tensions, primarily between the U.S. and China, are also weighing on the dollar, Turner with ING wrote. In a July 27 note, Goldman Sachs currency strategists forecast the trade-weighted U.S. dollar to weaken by an additional 5.3% over the next 12 months as the dollar is negatively correlated with the health of the global economy, which continues to improve outside the U.S. The trade-weighted U.S. dollar has fallen 4% since mid-May. \"Despite the recent selloff, the team believes the greenback remains overvalued by most metrics and offers poor fundamentals,\" David Kostin, Goldman's chief equity strategist, wrote in the note. Kostin wrote that the weakening dollar may be a catalyst for foreign investor demand for U.S. stocks. Over the past 40 years, an annual average of $96 billion in U.S. equities have been purchased by foreign investor during periods when the trade-weighted U.S. dollar fell by more than 2%, according to a Goldman analysis. Only $14 billion in U.S. equities were purchased by foreign investors while the U.S. dollar rose by more than 2%, according to the analysis.

In Europe, many governments have also imposed nationwide lockdown measures restricting business operations, gatherings and social contact, disrupting the lives of hundreds of millions of people and the operations of thousands of businesses. While some European countries are still struggling with the pandemic, some other European countries have already relaxed or announced plans to relax some of the restrictions. In this blog, we would like to compare the most recent trade credit activity and payment behavior of SMEs in eight European countries, aiming to assess the similarities and differences of the impact of COVID-19 among European SMEs. Research Data We extracted 1.4 million companies from our Trade Payment Database for eight European countries: Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Outstanding trade credit balances at month end are reported by creditors (i.e., suppliers) and are aggregated for each debtor (i.e. customers). As displayed in Figure 1, the majority of the companies are SMEs with less than 250 employees. Figure 1: Distribution of companies by the number of employees Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, June 5, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Are companies able to obtain sufficient trade credits? The use of trade credit is driven by both the supply and demand side. On the demand side, the trade credits are positively correlated to the customers\u2019 business activities and the demand for production goods. On the supply side, the trade credits are negatively correlated to suppliers\u2019 risk aversion. By looking at the amount of trade credits obtained by companies, we can estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. In Figure 2, we show the monthly aggregated outstanding trade credit balances per country. January\u2019s values are used as the pre-COVID-19 benchmark. This is because COVID-19 was first flagged to the World Health Organization by China on New Year\u2019s Eve [2] , and several Chinese cities went into lockdown in late January, causing severe disruption to the global supply chain. In February, when the number of COVID-19 cases was still lower in Europe and the majority of businesses still operated as usual, the impact of the virus had already reached the United Kingdom. The largest contribution to this drop is in the Metals and Mining sector. It is not surprising as the United Kingdom\u2019s major export to China is precious metal. When the virus started spreading uncontrollably throughout Europe in March, Italy was the hardest hit as indicated by the largest drop in trade credit balance from February, which was impacted mainly by the slowdown of business in the Wholesale and Retail sector. Entering into April, all European countries were under different degrees of lockdown/social distancing measures. Trade credit balances decreased for all these countries. When the pandemic started to be brought under control in May, we observed two opposite patterns for trade credit balances: a rebound for Belgium, Ireland and Italy; and a further drop for the remaining countries, which is especially noticeable for France and Sweden. Figure 2: Monthly outstanding trade credit balances (2020 January level = 100) Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, June 5, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Are companies paying their trade credits on time? We analyze the time series of trade credit balances and deduce the payment behavior in each month. In Figure 3, we illustrate the percentage of trade credit balances being paid on time in each country. When individual countries decided to lock down their cities in March, companies in Belgium, France and Ireland were seriously hit. The percentage of on-time payments was 32%, 23% and 16%; lower than February\u2019s values. However, we see a significant rebound for these three countries in April. The payment behavior in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom remained stable during the pandemic. We observe a small drop for the Netherlands in February, the United Kingdom in March and Sweden in April, but they were followed by an immediate rebound in the following month. The observed rebound pattern of the on-time payment across different European countries may indicate the success in providing emergency liquidity to the impacted businesses by the corresponding government. Figure 3: Monthly average percentage of trade credit balances being paid on time Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, June 5, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. We also use our proprietary statistical model, trained on historical payment data, to produce a likely scenario on the payment behavior in June (i.e. green diagonal-shaded bars in Figure 3). The model predicts a slight deterioration for Italy, a moderate deterioration for Germany, France, Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and a significant deterioration for Belgium and the Netherlands, using the payment behavior from the most recent months and the historical month-over-month correlation of payment behavior. Summary There is no doubt the pandemic has slowed down business activity in the eight European countries we analyzed. From trade credit data, we see the impact of COVID-19 reached these European countries at different points in time and at different levels of severity. In June, we even observe a recovery in trade credit for Belgium and Italy. The latest increase in trade credit balance in Italy could be linked to the end of the stricter lockdown measures in the country, since the middle of May. Further data for the following month may confirm the recovery trend, keeping in mind that trade credit balances are highly seasonal and will likely remain quite volatile during these uncertain periods. With regards to the payment behavior of companies, the percentage balance of trade credit being paid on time in May is similar to the pre-COVID-19 level. Although some of these countries experienced a drop in on-time payments in March or April, it was followed by a rebound in the next month. Our proprietary model predicts different levels of deterioration in payment behavior across these countries. Governments in Europe have launched significant measures, ranging from tax deferrals to access to finance and grants, to help business struggling through the pandemic. It is likely that the governments will continue to ramp up their support measures. The governments support and the further relaxation of lockdown rules may create a difference between our model predictions and the actual payment behavior of businesses in the future.

Two hours later, a handful of Wetherspoons pubs will be among the first in the country to pour pints for anyone nursing a thirst at such an early hour. \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d, as it has been called, offers a rare glimmer of hope for an industry that has been staring into the abyss since the coronavirus pandemic hit. Of England\u2019s 37,500 pubs, about 28,000 are capable of opening under a physical distancing requirement of 1 metre, according to the British Beer and Pubs Association. About 60%, or 22,000, are planning to do so from this week, bringing an end to three-and-a-half long, dry months. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Physical distancing measures in place at BrewDog Tower Hill , London. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images Yet the mood is not entirely merry. Nerves are jangling in the publican fraternity, as cautious optimism is tempered by anxiety about what lies in store for the next 24 hours and beyond. \u201cPeople are frightened of opening tomorrow,\u201d says Dave Mountford, landlord of the Boat In at Cromford, Derbyshire, and long-time pubs campaigner. \u201cThey\u2019re being forced into it because they can\u2019t afford not to.\u201d Protective measures are already in place, such as staff wearing \u201cbeer goggles\u201d and traffic light systems at the toilets . Yet the remaining pitfalls are legion, from marauding drinkers causing trouble to shortages of beer, food and even security staff. Facebook Twitter Pinterest It\u2019s been a long, dry three-and-a-half months for pubs. Photograph: Simon Newman/Reuters At the top of the list of concerns is the capricious local interpretation of government guidelines. Experts fear overzealous police and council officials will attempt to shut down pubs on spurious grounds. Sarah Clover of Kings Chambers, a leading barrister on licensing law, says: \u201cEnforcers often do not understand the difference between guidance and law. \u201cThe first licensees who put their head above the parapet are going to be descended upon by an army of agencies looking to see if they\u2019re doing it wrong. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get people telling retailers like Primark they\u2019d close them down because they don\u2019t have the power to do that, but they do with licensees. \u201cThey [publicans] are very nervous that enforcers are going to do this because they can and, in my opinion, some of them will. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Physical distancing measures in place at booths and banquettes at BrewDog Tower Hill in London. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images \u201cYou\u2019ll have rogue licensees and rogue enforcers and it\u2019s a toxic mix that we\u2019ll see played out big time over the weekend.\u201d Part of the problem, says Clover, is that the guidelines are ambiguous. For instance, they suggest playing music and live sports quietly so that people don\u2019t shout over the noise, increasing the risk of spreading the virus. At local level, says Clover, some police services have erroneously told publicans that they\u2019re not allowed to show football. Liz Hind, landlady of the Old Millwrights Arms in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is delaying her reopening for 24 hours, preferring to wait for the more sedate Sunday dog-walkers\u2019 crowd. But even she fears the tap on the shoulder from police, licensing officers or environmental health. \u201cWe asked for information three weeks ago but we only got the government guidelines 10 days ago,\u201d she says. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Most bars will operate a non-cash payment system. Photograph: Hollie Adams/Getty Images \u201cI\u2019ll do my best to interpret them but who knows if it will be good enough. \u201cWe know they\u2019ve got the power to come in and just close us down and we are expecting that they\u2019ll use that in some cases, even though we\u2019re all just trying to do our best in really difficult circumstances.\u201d Such trepidation is echoed across the industry but some fear more fundamental obstacles, such as shortages of beer and food. \u201cA lot of brewers only started brewing last week and certain products take a few weeks to brew,\u201d says Joanne Cox-Brown, director of Night Time Economy Solutions. \u201cThere could be similar issues on food, too.\u201d In some areas, bouncers are said to be in short supply, a headache given the potentially heady mix of constrained capacity with nearly four months of pent-up rowdiness . \u201cWe\u2019re seeing security staff who aren\u2019t keen on coming back after working in retail or other industries, where they\u2019re paid the same money for more regular hours,\u201d says Cox-Brown. The prevailing mood in the pubs trade is that Saturday was a bad choice for unleashing England\u2019s pubgoers. Facebook Twitter Pinterest James McAlister, manager at the Morning Star Bar and Restaurant in Belfast, who said it had been a great feeling to reopen the doors on Friday morning following lockdown. Photograph: Rebecca Black/PA Indeed, some of the UK\u2019s biggest pub companies have taken a wait-and-see approach. Greene King won\u2019t be opening any of its 1,700 pubs on Saturday, waiting instead for the rather calmer Monday trade. London-based Young\u2019s isn\u2019t serving until later in July and Fuller\u2019s is only opening 27 out of 215 this weekend, phasing them in after that. But the flip side of anxiety about overcrowding on Saturday night is the concern that not enough people will return to make pubs viable. Of 25,000 people surveyed by FindOutNow, 93% plan to give \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d a miss. But according to a survey by the Royal Society for Public Health, almost half of people plan to stay away well beyond that, for at least three months.

Loans to limited-service restaurants, particularly national franchises, may pose less credit risk relative to full-service restaurants as the coronavirus pandemic keeps many businesses closed and customers at home. Full-service restaurants generally offer a broad range of food and drink options as well as a wait staff. Examples include Outback Steakhouse and Red Lobster. At limited-service restaurants, customers pay before dining. Generally, the menus are more focused with a greater emphasis on lower-priced items that can be prepared quickly \u2014 think McDonald's. A survey by the National Restaurant Association found that year-over-year sales for the first 10 days of April were down by more than 80% each for full-service categories: family dining, casual dining and fine dining. The sales declines were less pronounced for some limited-service categories: 57% for quick service and 64% for fast casual. \"While nearly every limited-service operator also reported lower sales, the losses were somewhat less severe,\" wrote the association's chief economist, Bruce Grindy. \"This is because most of these operations were already well-equipped to handle off-premises traffic, which is the only option available throughout most of the country where mandated dining area closures have been implemented.\" Among banks in the S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis, Wells Fargo & Co. reported the highest balance of restaurant loans. At March 31, Wells Fargo had $5.8 billion in outstanding exposure, $3.9 billion of which was to limited-service restaurants according to an April 14 financial supplement. Houston-based Cadence Bancorp. reported the highest proportion of restaurant loans to gross loans, with a ratio of 8.1% as of March 31. More than two-thirds of its outstanding exposure was to limited service based on an April 29 investor presentation. The Cadence Bank Restaurant Group, or CBRG, houses the vast majority of the company's restaurant loans. In the bank's April 29 earnings conference call, Cadence Bancorp Chairman and CEO Paul Murphy Jr. described pizza quick-service restaurants as \"the most resilient segment\" of CBRG. He said that year-over-year same-store sales there have been \"pretty flat.\" He also said that the full-service segment of the portfolio was experiencing the most stress, with weekly sales declines of at least 60%. Nearly one-third of the CBRG portfolio at March 31 was to franchisees of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, which are divisions of Yum! Brands Inc. Another 16% was allocated to franchisees of The Wendy's Co. and Burger King. CBRG banks 20 of the top 40 U.S. restaurant franchisee companies. \"It is our belief that as the industry restructures and reopens, it's reasonable to expect that these stronger brands will recover faster, especially in light of the fact that some of the weaker brands may not survive,\" Murphy said. Citizens Financial Group Inc. also highlighted one of the advantages of franchise lending: a wide array of potential assistance during economic turmoil. \"Franchisees benefit from strong franchisor support with concessions and deferrals of base rents, royalties and suspended cap-ex requirements,\" an April 17 investor presentation from the bank noted. About 42% of Citizens Financial's $2.9 billion outstanding food services and drinking places portfolio was to franchisees of McDonald's Corp. And another 32% of the exposure was to other fast food and fast casual. Rosemont, Ill.-based Wintrust Financial Corp. listed two other ways that franchisors could provide relief in its April 22 investor presentation: advertising help and supplier negotiations. At March 31, Wintrust held $994 million of franchise loans, and 85% of this was to quick service. Miami Lakes, Fla.-based BankUnited Inc. reported $401 million in franchise finance restaurant loans. Exposure from the April 29 investor presentation included $67 million to Burger King, $39 million to Dunkin' Donuts, $28 million to Sonic, $26 million to Domino's Pizza Inc. and $23 million to Jimmy John's. According to an April 21 investor presentation, the top chains in Cincinnati-based First Financial Bancorp.'s franchise portfolio were Domino's, Burger King, Denny's, Golden Corral and Arby's. Some of the smaller restaurant portfolios at banks are tilted toward full service. At Rockland, Mass.-based Independent Bank Corp., approximately two-thirds of its $155 million food services portfolio was devoted to full-service restaurants. In an 8-K filed April 23, the bank said the average borrower loan size is approximately $388,000 and approximately 61% of the loan balances outstanding are secured by real estate assets with a portfolio balance weighted average loan-to-value of 46.7%. More than half of Trustmark Corp.'s $116 million restaurant loan segment at the end of March was to full service. The Jackson, Miss.-based bank disclosed in an April 29 investor presentation that 74% of the restaurant portfolio was real estate-secured and provided the components to calculate an average loan size of around $337,000.

The Johnnie Walker whisky maker took the 1.3 billion pound non-cash writedown related to its businesses in India, Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Windsor whisky brand in South Korea, blaming challenging trading conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On Tuesday, the company reported an 8.4% drop in organic sales for the year ended June 30, larger than the 7.3% fall analysts had expected, company supplied estimates showed. This marks the company's worst annual sales performance in more than a decade, according to Bernstein analysts. Diageo shares were down 6.2% in early trading and was the biggest loser on the FTSE <.FTSE>. The stock is down nearly 10% this year, better than the FTSE's 20% decline over the same period. By region, organic sales in Asia fell the most, dropping 16% due to the impact of coronavirus-related closures of alcohol outlets and bars in India and Thailand, while in China demand was hit by the absence of the Chinese New Year. The company's Latin America, Africa and Europe and Turkey markets also posted double-digit falls in sales, mainly due to disruptions to supply chains and fewer social occasions due to the pandemic. North America was the only bright spot, with sales rising 2%, reflecting strong demand for tequilas and ready-to-drink beverages at supermarkets and alcohol stores, the company said. Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said the strong results in North America, its biggest market by revenue, was because 80% of Diageo's sales came from retail stores, in contrast to other markets, where bars and restaurants make up most of the sales. The company, which also makes Tanqueray Gin, Smirnoff Vodka and a wide range of scotch whiskey, said it was still unable to provide specific outlook for the year, after abandoning a full-year forecast in April. Its 4.5 billion pound capital returns programme remains suspended. \"The hit to earnings should be short lived provided the global economy doesn't take too long to recover,\" William Ryder, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said. \"We think the group will continue to do well long term, but management will have to focus more on debt reduction than they probably would have liked.\" The company also said it would keep paying a dividend, which Liberum analyst Nico Von Stackelberg called a \"positive sign\". After a tough second half of the year \"we should see sequential improvements (in the business) from here,\" he said in a note. Diageo's business outlook was in contrast to French spirits makers Pernod Ricard <PERP.PA> and Remy Cointreau <RCOP.PA> , which last month said the pandemic would not hit their full-year forecasts as strongly as initially feared. Diageo's impairment charge follows those of other alcoholic beverage makers, AB InBev <ABI.BR> and Heineken <HEIN.AS>. While AB Inbev took a $2.5 billion writedown related to its African operations last week, Heineken announced a nearly 550 million euro writedown on Monday.

The S&P 500 rose 1.76% for the week ending July 10 to close at 3,185.04, while the SNL U.S. Insurance Index declined 0.45% to 993.42. Stocks gained steam on the final trading day of the week after Gilead Sciences Inc. announced that its remdesivir treatment seems to reduce the risk of death for COVID-19 patients. CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said the increase in coronavirus cases has raised fears for insurers, particularly those in P&C lines, about the prospect of a longer economic crisis that could include new lockdown orders. \"If we end up going into another lockdown, what does this mean for auto insurance usage?\" Seifert said in an interview, adding that insurers might have to consider further premium credits should driving decrease again from another aggressive lockdown. \"There are certain regions that are just out of control, so I think that casts a pall over almost anything else that's going on,\" she said. A majority of states reported a rise in positive tests this week, and total cases in the U.S. topped the 3 million mark. Several states have slowed down their reopening plans, while harder-hit ones like Arizona, California, Florida and Texas have shut down or limited certain areas of commerce, such as bars or indoor dining. Seifert also said the insurance market was moved by a pair of M&A deals announced this week: Allstate Corp.'s pending acquisition of National General Holdings Corp. for approximately $4 billion cash, and KKR & Co. Inc. agreeing to buy Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd., also for around $4 billion. Seifert said the deals, particularly Allstate's, have \"lit a bit of a fire\" under the smaller insurers in the market, fueling hopes that other companies will do the same. National General's share price rose sharply, soaring 61.87%, while Allstate was one of the week's biggest decliners, falling 7.57%. The deal, Seifert said, may have given Allstate \"a little bit of a bump\" in market share and increased exposure to the independent agent market, but investors would have preferred something more like buying a specialty or supplemental insurer. \"Instead, they sort of ... went back to the drawing board and paid up to get a 1% increase in market share,\" she said. Seifert in a note maintained her \"buy\" rating and target price of $118 on Allstate, saying that the auto insurance market will further consolidate \"with Allstate at the top of that pyramid.\" The rally on July 10 helped some P&C insurers finish higher for the week, including Cincinnati Financial Corp., up 8.65%; Kemper Corp., up 6.73%; and Chubb Ltd., up 2.28%. Reinsurance-focused Alleghany Corp. was down marginally, and Reinsurance Group of America Inc. lost 6.90%. Managed care companies like UnitedHealth Group Inc., Anthem Inc., Humana Inc. and Molina Healthcare Inc. all lost ground.

Photograph: Premier League/PA Richard Masters, the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, has had a busy few weeks dealing with the failed Newcastle takeover. Photograph: Premier League/PA Paul MacInnes @ PaulMac Published on Thu 6 Aug 2020 00.01 BST The Premier League must change its rules to prevent human-rights abusers from taking control of clubs, Amnesty International has said. In a letter to the chief executive, Richard Masters, Amnesty has suggested changes to the owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test that would disqualify prospective owners \u201con the grounds of contributing to human-rights violations\u201d. It comes after the collapse of the Saudi Arabian bid to take over Newcastle , a move Amnesty described as \u201csportswashing\u201d. The test prevents individuals from becoming directors if they fail to meet certain limited criteria. These include having previously been disqualified from holding such a role, having been subject to a bankruptcy order or having an unspent criminal conviction in the UK. The test does prevent a director from being appointed if \u201cin the reasonable opinion of the board, he or she has engaged in conduct outside the United Kingdom that would constitute an offence \u2026 if such conduct had taken place in the United Kingdom\u201d. The offences described are limited to \u201cdishonesty\u201d, however, including \u201cdishonestly receiving a programme broadcast from within the UK with intent to avoid payment\u201d. The phrase human rights does not appear in the text, which runs to six pages in the Premier League handbook. Amnesty\u2019s proposed changes were devised by two corporate lawyers, David Chivers QC and Seamus Woods of Erskine Chambers, and centre on a proposal that a director should not be considered fit and proper if \u201che or she has been complicit in an egregious or consistent violation(s) of international human rights law\u201d. The changes also suggest that a director should be barred if their association with \u201cany government or organisation\u201d might risk \u201cbringing the league, the club and/or the game into serious disrepute\u201d. Amnesty claims the changes would not cut across any of the league\u2019s other commitments. \u201cThe controversy around the Saudi-Newcastle takeover has been a major wake-up call \u2013 the Premier League urgently needs to get its house in order,\u201d said Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK\u2019s director. \u201cThe owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test is hopelessly unsuited to the task of vetting who gets to own and run English football clubs \u2013 it needs a serious overhaul. At present, anyone wishing to sportswash their reputation by buying into English football can do so knowing that even their involvement in war crimes or torture wouldn\u2019t stop them. \u201cThe owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test simply hasn\u2019t kept up with modern trends in international football ownership, not least with foreign powers buying their way into the game.\u201d The Premier League said it would not comment on the letter.

Regulation * The U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C., rejected a lawsuit brought by plaintiff Laura Loomer and nonprofit Freedom Watch in 2018, accusing four tech companies of breaching First Amendment rights, TechCrunch reports .

CEO Hans Vestberg said the company began the emergency crisis operations center to address staffers' questions in early February, TechCrunch reports , citing an interview with the executive.

McCombie Fool.co.uk 8 June 2020 Reblog Share Tweet Share Shelves holding drinks bottles More I think Young\u2019s (LSE: YNGA) is the best pub stock to buy today as pubs look set to open early than expected. Ministers are pushing for outside spaces, like beer gardens and terraces, to be allowed to open on 22 June. Inside spaces should open later on 4 July. However, I would caution investors against getting overly optimistic about the pub sector in general. Its a pub, just not as we know it For one thing, a new spike in coronavirus infections could push back the reopening dates, or force pubs to shut again. For another, the planned reopenings will be very restrictive. Two-metre social distancing will limit customer numbers to under 40% of normal. There will be queues to get in and for toilets, and propping up the bar will not be allowed. Some pub chains have already opened for takeaway during the spell of sunny weather. Passing pints over the walls to customers to consume elsewhere was not widespread, and you have to wonder why. It might be because supermarkets and corner shops already sell alcohol for consumption off the premises. Or it could be because most pubs didn\u2019t want to risk people getting drunk in public on their beer. It could also be that a takeaway service did not make financial sense. Pubs are burning through cash as premises sit idle, but they could continue to do so with limited openings. I think the number of staff will need to be something like a world cup semi-final would call for, but with a fraction of the customers. And those customers might not be knocking their drinks back like they used to. Pacing themselves Young\u2019s boss has said none of its pubs will open before early August. Given that Young\u2019s has already warned of a substantial loss for 2020 and has cut its dividend, it might sound mad to pass on the option to open early. But I see Young\u2019s not in a hurry to rush an opening as a reason why its the best pub stock to buy today. The company has already informed investors that it could remain closed without going bust until March 2021. It has made use of the government\u2019s job retention and business rate relief schemes, and will not want to jeopardise them until it makes sense to do so. Young\u2019s management expects social distancing rules of one-metre in August, which should allow pubs to operate at around 70% of capacity. At over two-thirds capacity, it seems Young\u2019s management is confident of at least not adding to the losses it is already making. It could also learn from the experiences of other pubs that may open this month, and avoid a potentially tricky emergency shut down should the outbreak spike again in the coming weeks. Last orders, please Getting a slice of Young\u2019s pre-crisis revenue, earnings, and dividend growth would be a steal at the current share price. Emerging from the crisis in an orderly fashion and avoiding doing more damage will help Young\u2019s get back on track. Having management brave enough to keep doors shut until it makes sense to open \u2013\u00a0and having the financial strength to allow this \u2013\u00a0bodes well for Young\u2019s.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it\u2019s justified. Barco could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You\u2019d really hope so, otherwise you\u2019re paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for Barco ENXTBR:BAR Price Based on Past Earnings July 22nd 2020 Keen to find out how analysts think Barco\u2019s future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start . Is There Enough Growth For Barco? Barco\u2019s P/E ratio would be typical for a company that\u2019s expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market. If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company\u2019s profits fell to the tune of 31%. However, a few very strong years before that means that it was still able to grow EPS by an impressive 409% in total over the last three years. Accordingly, while they would have preferred to keep the run going, shareholders would probably welcome the medium-term rates of earnings growth. Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 32% per annum as estimated by the three analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 7.9% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result. With this information, we can see why Barco is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock. What We Can Learn From Barco\u2019s P/E? Generally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company. We\u2019ve established that Barco maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn\u2019t great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It\u2019s hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances. Having said that, be aware Barco is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about. Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with a strong growth track record, trading on a P/E below 20x.

A closer look at results reported by the British drinks company for the fiscal year ended June 30 indicates that the impact was especially severe in geographic regions dominated by emerging economies. The three regions of Asia Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean account for 19%, 12% and 8% of Diageo's net sales, respectively. Diageo noted that growth in North America during the year had not been enough to offset declines in all other regions, including Europe. As a result, organic net sales for the group as a whole fell 8.4%, and organic volumes dropped 11.2%. Diageo makes Guinness beer, Johnnie Walker whiskey and Tanqueray gin, among other brands. The company's shares were down 5.4% to 2,725 pence in early afternoon trading in London. \"In Europe, around 50% of our sales are normally on-trade, and Africa is a strongly on-trade-oriented region,\" CEO Ivan Menzies said Aug. 4 on a call with analysts. \"As these two regions are our largest beer markets, the decline in our beer business looked significant during COVID-19. In aggregate, around three-quarters of Guinness sales are on-trade in the larger Guinness markets in Europe and Africa.\" On-trade refers to sales made at venues such as restaurants, hotels and bars. Menzies added that the impact of the pandemic \"was also disproportionately high for our Scotch category due to its greater exposure to emerging markets and travel retail. Together, they account for over two-thirds of our Scotch net sales prior to COVID-19.\" Alcohol producers including Diageo, Pernod Ricard SA, Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA and Heineken NV have been hit hard by the effective closure of the bulk of the global hospitality industry, as well as the massive blow that travel restrictions have had on tourism and airport-based retail. More shoppers are now buying lower-priced alcoholic drinks from grocery stores and online outlets and consuming them at home, but that increase has not been enough to offset price stagnation and falling on-premise sales. Diageo said its net sales in Africa fell 13% as growth in the first half was outweighed by the pandemic impact in the second half of the year. East Africa declined 10% with continued beer growth in Tanzania offset by lockdown closures affecting on-trade in Kenya and Uganda. Net sales in Nigeria dropped 20% with double-digit declines in beer and scotch. In South Africa, net sales plunged 25%, driven by scotch and vodka, as a result of both on-trade and off-trade closures and a difficult economic climate. The country recently imposed its second ban on alcohol sales, which companies such as AB Inbev are hoping to reverse. Diageo's net sales in Asia Pacific dropped 16%. Despite growth in the first half for the region, all markets other than Australia declined due to the impact of COVID-19. Greater China declined 7% as scotch, liqueurs and beer growth was offset by declines in Chinese white spirits. In India, net sales fell 17%, triggered by an economic slowdown, a 42-day nationwide lockdown, regulatory changes and the continuation of on-trade closures thereafter. But after the lockdown was lifted, the Indian business has seen sequential improvement from May through July. The COVID-hit to Indian sales \"doesn't change our view on India at all for the long term,\" said CFO Kathryn Mikells on the call, noting that the company's business hoped to benefit from long-term trends such as population growth and increases in per-capita income. \"And really importantly, the people in India just love whiskey. ... So I would say, over the long term, we continue to be very bold, but that's a business that's going to be good for Diageo, good for its shareholders.\" Author Gautam Naik Theme Retail & Consumer Products About Us Quality Program Contact Us Email Subscription Center Press Releases Careers Corporate Responsibility Our History Investor Relations Leadership \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Terms of Use Cookie Notice Privacy Policy Disclosures Do Not Sell My Personal Information"},

The Reubens \u2013 David, 81, and Simon, 79 \u2013 are ranked second in the Sunday Times Rich List with a fortune of \u00a316bn and own the Wellington Pub Company, which has a portfolio of 750 pubs. The business has demanded full rent from some of its pub tenants who have not traded since March. The tenants fear that the bills will force them out of business if they are not given some concessions such as a rent holiday or reduced bills. There is nothing to suggest that the Reubens have been specifically involved in or are aware of the rent demands. Kate Ahrens, who has rented the Geese and Fountain in the Vale of Belvoir, Leicestershire, from Wellington since 2015, told the Guardian and ITV News: \u201cWe took on this pub when it had been shut for four years. We have scrimped and saved and on a shoestring built it up to what it is now. And we were maybe, maybe, just beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of just making a little bit of money for us. That\u2019s gone. \u201cAnd, you know, that\u2019s fundamentally, that\u2019s the choice I\u2019m looking at, is either be completely skint for years or be completely bankrupt.\u201d Joanne Antick, another Wellington tenant who runs the King\u2019s Arms in Brentford, west London, added: \u201cI really don\u2019t understand, how can we pay rent when we don\u2019t have any income? I really hope that they realise we just can\u2019t do this. I will go under. \u201cThey [Reuben Bros] are successful people which I admire. God, I admire anybody that\u2019s worked hard and is successful but with success comes responsibility. I\u2019m successful in my small way. They\u2019re so successful and they bought all these pubs. Eight hundred pubs. And with that they bought my life and they\u2019ve got to be responsible ... I need help\u201d. Both tenants, along with others, complain that their efforts to secure rent reductions \u2013 or be given rent holidays \u2013 have been unsuccessful. The row between the tenants and their pub company has erupted as the prime minister announced on Tuesday that some pubs and bars will be able to reopen from next month. It also comes just days after the government extended rules designed to allow businesses more time to pay debts run up by the lack of trade during the coronavirus pandemic, while it has published a voluntary code of practice designed to advise landlords and tenants on how to resolve disputes caused by the pandemic. The code states: \u201c Landlords should be willing to consider a reasonable case put forward by a tenant in such distress and whether some temporary arrangement the landlord can reasonably offer might enable the tenant to survive.\u201d It adds: \u201cLandlords seeking to refuse concessions should be clear with their tenants about why they are doing so. This means providing a reasonable explanation of their decision which clearly takes into account the information provided by the tenant.\u201d A spokesperson for Wellington said: \u201cWellington is a standalone business and has obligations in the form of a securitisation for which payments must be made quarterly. \u201cWe can confirm that rent was invoiced in June in accordance with lease/tenancy agreements in place and other legal requirements. The invoices were sent out with a covering note and reference to the publicly available statement [which is] explicit that action against rental arrears arising solely due to the closure period of pubs caused by Covid-19 will not be taken. \u201cThe number of properties involved means it takes time to contact all tenants and this exercise is ongoing.\u201d Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative MP who chairs parliament\u2019s liaison committee, said he had spoken to the Reuben family on behalf of Wellington tenants in his constituency of Harwich and North Essex. \u201cI am very clear that the period during which pubs and restaurants were locked down, they should not be required to pay rent for that period at the very least, and they should really not be required to pay rent until they got back on their feet again.\u201d The brothers are also part of a consortium currently looking to buy the Premier League football team Newcastle United and their family has donated more than \u00a3500,000 to the Conservative party over the past year.

Nikkei futures were trading 0.3% below the Nikkei 225 index's previous close.  Wall Street shares ended higher after choppy trade as hopes mounted U.S. leaders would agree on another coronavirus stimulus package. Reuters GLOBAL MARKETS-Gold soars past $2,000, gold up on stimulus plan Gold surged past the $2,000 mark on Tuesday after Democrats and the White House appeared closer to agreement on new stimulus to help the coronavirus-hit economy while stocks on Wall Street ended higher as investors awaited more aid from Washington.  Oil prices also rose on the prospect of more stimulus but Treasury yields fell to their lowest since March on safe-haven demand and concerns about the ultimate cost of aid.  Gold prices breached the psychological $2,000 level for the first time, propelled by stimulus concerns. Advertise With Us \u00a9 2020 Verizon Media. All rights reserved.

Simply Wall St July 7, 2020 It is doubtless a positive to see that the The City Pub Group plc ( LON:CPC ) share price has gained some 35% in the last three months. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the returns over the last year have been disappointing. Like a receding glacier in a warming world, the share price has melted 54% in that period. The share price recovery is not so impressive when you consider the fall. Of course, it could be that the fall was overdone. View our latest analysis for City Pub Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. Unfortunately City Pub Group reported an EPS drop of 36% for the last year. This reduction in EPS is not as bad as the 54% share price fall. Unsurprisingly, given the lack of EPS growth, the market seems to be more cautious about the stock. The company\u2019s earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). AIM:CPC Earnings Per Share Growth July 7th 2020 It\u2019s probably worth noting we\u2019ve seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here. . A Different Perspective We doubt City Pub Group shareholders are happy with the loss of 54% over twelve months. That falls short of the market, which lost 9.7%. There\u2019s no doubt that\u2019s a disappointment, but the stock may well have fared better in a stronger market. It\u2019s great to see a nice little 35% rebound in the last three months. This could just be a bounce because the selling was too aggressive, but fingers crossed it\u2019s the start of a new trend. It\u2019s always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand City Pub Group better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example \u2013 City Pub Group has 5 warning signs (and 2 which are potentially serious) we think you should know about. City Pub Group is not the only stock insiders are buying.

Among its discoveries are three clinical-stage therapeutics: mavacamten (formerly MYK-461); danicamtiv (formerly MYK-491) and MYK-224.\u00a0\u00a0MyoKardia\u2019s mission is to change the world for people with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.Contacts: Michelle Corral   Corporate Communications & Investor Relations  MyoKardia, Inc.  650-351-4690  mcorral@myokardia.comHannah Deresiewicz (investors)  Stern Investor Relations, Inc.  212-362-1200  hannah.deresiewicz@sternir.com GlobeNewswire MyoKardia Reports Second Quarter 2020 Financial Results BRISBANE, Calif., Aug. 04, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MyoKardia, Inc. (Nasdaq: MYOK), today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020.  \u201cThe second quarter of 2020 was one of incredible progress across our R&D pipeline, including the exciting new data from our danicamtiv program highlighting its unique ability to directly activate both the left atrium and the left ventricle, and capped off by the positive results from our pivotal Phase 3 EXPLORER trial. These data, together with a successful financing, position us well in the pursuit of our mission to change the world for the tens of millions of people with serious cardiovascular disease,\u201d said Tassos Gianakakos, MyoKardia\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe are highly focused on the U.S. regulatory approval and successful launch of mavacamten and continue to develop evidence supporting its potential as a backbone therapy for people with HCM and possibly beyond. Beyond mavacamten and danicamtiv, the application of our R&D platform continues to be fruitful and is generating proprietary scientific insights that could lead to several important new therapies.\u201dClinical Program HighlightsMavacamten for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy  * Positive Phase 3 Topline Data from EXPLORER-HCM: MyoKardia announced positive topline data from its Phase 3 pivotal EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial of mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Mavacamten demonstrated a robust treatment effect: the primary and all secondary endpoints were met with statistical significance (p\u22640.0006). Mavacamten was well tolerated, and meaningful improvements in symptoms, functional status and quality of life, as well as reduction or elimination in obstruction of the left ventricle, were observed among patients on treatment versus placebo.   \u00a0  * EXPLORER Data Accepted for Late-Breaker Presentation at ESC 2020: The Phase 3 data from the EXPLORER-HCM clinical trial have been accepted as a late-breaker presentation at the upcoming virtual European Society of Cardiology (ESC) meeting. Dr. Iacopo Olivotto, from the Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy, will present the data on Saturday, August 29, 2020 at 6:30 CET.   \u00a0  * Breakthrough Therapy Designation Granted by FDA: MyoKardia announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to mavacamten for the treatment of symptomatic, obstructive HCM. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is planned for use to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. MyoKardia plans to submit a New Drug Application to the FDA in the first quarter of 2021.   \u00a0  * Initiated VALOR-HCM Phase 3 Clinical Trial: The Phase 3 VALOR-HCM trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to provide direct clinical evidence of mavacamten\u2019s ability to improve outcomes for individuals with HCM by reducing the need for invasive septal reduction therapy (SRT) procedures. VALOR-HCM is being conducted in partnership with Cleveland Clinic C5Research, an academic research organization, with participation from approximately 15 HCM specialty centers with well-recognized expertise in SRT procedures in the U.S.Danicamtiv for Dilated Cardiomyopathy   * Presented and Published Encouraging Danicamtiv Clinical and Non-clinical Data: In a Phase 2a clinical trial, danicamtiv was generally well-tolerated in patients with stable chronic heart failure and was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in left ventricular (LV) contractility, including statistically significant increases in LV stroke volume, without impairing the heart\u2019s ability to relax and fill. Treatment with danicamtiv also improved left atrial (LA) volume and function, a new and potentially important finding given LA size is a well-established prognostic factor for atrial fibrillation. Data from nonclinical studies indicate that danicamtiv directly activates the LV and LA, providing mechanistic rationale for the robust changes observed clinically. These data were presented at the European Society of Cardiology\u2019s Heart Failure Association (HFA) Discoveries online event, and published in the European Journal of Heart Failure.    Pending circumstances related to the coronavirus pandemic, MyoKardia expects to initiate a Phase 2 study in patients with genetic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in the second half of 2020 and a Phase 2 study in patients with systolic heart failure and paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation in the first half of 2021.Research  * Entered into Collaboration with Fulcrum Therapeutics: MyoKardia announced a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Fulcrum Therapeutics. Under the agreement, MyoKardia will access Fulcrum\u2019s proprietary target discovery engine to identify therapeutics that control the expression of genes known to be underlying drivers of genetic cardiomyopathies. MyoKardia will be responsible for all development and commercialization activities for, and will have global rights to, any potential therapeutics identified through this collaboration.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0In March 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, MyoKardia paused new patient enrollment in the MAVA-LTE long-term extension study of mavacamten and in the Phase 1 healthy volunteer study of MYK-224. The company has subsequently resumed enrollment in both studies.Recent Corporate Highlights  * Announced New General Counsel: MyoKardia appointed Denelle J. Waynick as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Cynthia Ladd, MyoKardia\u2019s former General Counsel, will be retiring following a transition period in the second half of 2020.  \u00a0  * Completed Successful Follow-On Offering: MyoKardia completed a follow-on offering of 6,037,500 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $105.00 per share, raising approximately $605.0 million in net proceeds. MyoKardia anticipates using net proceeds from the offering to support the regulatory approval process and potential commercial launch of mavacamten for the treatment of obstructive HCM; to fund ongoing and potential later-stage clinical trials of mavacamten in non-obstructive HCM and HFpEF, danicamtiv in targeted segments of systolic heart failure and MYK-224; to advance ACT-1 and LUS-1 into clinical development; to fund ongoing preclinical, discovery and research programs, and for working capital, business development and other general corporate purposes.Second Quarter 2020 Financial ResultsCash Position:\u00a0Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of\u00a0June 30, 2020\u00a0were\u00a0$918.1 million, compared to $430.3 million as of December 31, 2019.\u00a0 The increase in MyoKardia\u2019s cash position is primarily attributable to net proceeds of approximately $605.0 million from MyoKardia\u2019s follow-on offering of common stock, which priced in May 2020.R&D Expenses:\u00a0Research and development expenses were\u00a0$44.3 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared to\u00a0$27.7 million\u00a0for the same period in 2019. The increase in R&D expenses for the second quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of R&D reimbursements from Sanofi, our previous collaboration partner, increased personnel costs including stock-based compensation, as well as increases in R&D infrastructure, consulting, and contract manufacturing expenses.\u00a0\u00a0G&A Expenses:\u00a0General and administrative expenses were\u00a0$20.3 million\u00a0for the three months ended\u00a0June 30, 2020, compared to\u00a0$13.9 million\u00a0for the same period in 2019. The increase in G&A expenses for the second quarter of 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs including stock-based compensation, as well as increases in professional fees and marketing expenses.Net Loss:\u00a0Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was\u00a0$63.6 million ($1.27 per share), compared to a net loss of\u00a0$38.2 million ($0.83 loss per share) for the second quarter of 2019.Conference Call and Webcast  MyoKardia\u00a0management will host a conference call and live audio webcast on\u00a0Tuesday, August 4, 2020, at\u00a04:30 p.m. ET\u00a0/\u00a01:30 p.m. PT\u00a0to discuss current operations and second quarter 2020 financial results.

And while they are reducing their exposures in response to the pandemic, insurers are also applying lessons learned in the 2008 financial crisis to help their clients weather the storm and protect their own reputations. Claims on the way Trade credit insurance protects suppliers against non-payment or late payment for goods or services provided on credit, typically triggered by financial difficulty or insolvency of their trading partners. As a result, trade credit insurers are particularly exposed during economic downturns. The collective claims ratio for members of the International Credit Insurance & Surety Association, or ICISA, jumped to 84.9% in 2008 from 45.6% in 2007, and rose further to 87.0% in 2009 because of financial crisis claims. The coronavirus outbreak has already contributed to some insolvencies, such as long-struggling U.K. home furnishings company Laura Ashley. Although the picture is still highly uncertain, travel restrictions and the enforced closure of bars, restaurants and theaters to curtail the spread of the virus are expected to push more firms into financial difficulty. James Steele-Perkins, senior credit and political risk underwriter at Cincinnati Global Underwriting Ltd., said via email that the trade credit insurance market is \"highly correlated\" with the production, processing and sale of commodities, so \"naturally we're heavily exposed to the entire supply chain.\" He said that although the impact was \"anyone's guess,\" there would be \"delays, restructurings and no doubt insolvencies, particularly within the more volatile sectors \u2014 clearly the energy industry being one and the aviation sector another.\" Scott Ettien, global trade credit head at broker Willis Towers Watson PLC, said insurers are expecting \"severe spikes in insolvencies, which is going to trigger a lot of claims activity.\" Insurers would also need to set aside reserves for payments that were past their due dates, pushing up their overall incurred loss levels, he added in an interview. He projected that the three market leaders \u2014 Atradius NV, Coface SA and Euler Hermes Group SA \u2014 \"are going to get hit with the highest number of losses,\" although all trade credit insurers will face claims. The increase in claims is likely to hit underwriting performance, according to Manuel Arrive, a director in the insurance group at Fitch Ratings. He said in an interview that Fitch was expecting a \"deterioration in technical results\" as \"claim rates should be increasing significantly due to the rising corporate insolvencies in a context where global GDP growth is being crushed.\" A resilient market While trade credit insurers' underwriting results may suffer, capital levels are not at risk, for now at least. Robert Nijhout, executive director of ICISA, said in an interview that the industry is \"extremely well-capitalized\" thanks to Europe's Solvency II regime and that the industry's 2019 performance was \"very, very good.\" Ettien noted that while typical economic cycles last between six and eight years, there had been roughly 12 years since the last severe economic downturn, and that \"during that time the carriers have been financially doing very well and are well-capitalized.\" Nijhout also said that although the outbreak could prompt a wave of corporate insolvencies, trade credit insurers are \"geared up for this \u2014 this is how we are capitalized, this is how we are organized, this is how we are also in control of the risk we are underwriting.\" Arrive said the short-term nature of trade credit insurance meant that insurers could react quickly by implementing risk measures, such as reducing coverage limits. The big three trade credit insurers provide cancellable cover, which allows them to reduce or withdraw coverage limits if a customer looks likely to go bust or be unable to pay, thereby reducing their and their insureds' exposure. Insurers can also put up prices, Arrive said, adding that Fitch was expecting \"double-digit\" rate increases. Ettien said he was expecting prices to go up by more than 10% for new business, while price increases for existing clients were \"probably going to sit around the 10% range.\" Lessons learned Trade credit insurers' efforts to reduce their exposure through lower limits and higher prices could risk client relationships, however. Reducing limits \"is a risk management tool that they have here but they need to do business and not lose their clients,\" Arrive said. Ettien acknowledged that \"some people are going to get upset\" because of canceled credit limits and that \"it's not going to be a perfect world from that perspective.\" But he added that \"nobody is taking any drastic moves, any knee-jerk reactions\" on pulling back coverage, and that both insurers and clients seemed to be \"very level-headed\" in their responses. He added that insurer response to date has been \"night and day\" compared with the 2008 financial crisis \"and in my book they get an A+ on how they are reacting so far.\" Nijhout said ICISA's member insurers were being more flexible on extensions of customer payment deadlines. This would typically be \"more frowned upon because we want to know why companies don't pay,\" but given the pandemic it is \"much, much clearer\" why there is a delay, he said. The reason for insurers' measured response, according to Ettien, is the lessons learned in the 2008 financial crisis. He recalled that at the time the big three insurers were giving one day's notice of credit limit cancellation, which \"created a lot of problems.\" Since then, he said, they have introduced a \"delayed effect of cancellation\" endorsement to policies, allowing insureds time to reduce their exposures to troubled customers gradually over a 30-, 60- or 90-day period, provided that customers were not insolvent or already 60 days past their due payment date. Ettien said he expects the delayed effect endorsement to be tested during the coronavirus pandemic but that it will \"have a positive impact in this downturn for our insureds.\" He added: \"I think our reputation at the end of this is going to be stronger than what happened when we came out of 2008 \u2014 much, much stronger.\" Author Ben Dyson Theme Insurance About Us Quality Program Contact Us Email Subscription Center Press Releases Careers Corporate Responsibility Our History Investor Relations Leadership \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Terms of Use Cookie Notice Privacy Policy Disclosures Do Not Sell My Personal Information"},

Ei Group \u2013 formerly known as Enterprise Inns and which owns a portfolio of more than 4,000 pubs \u2013 has told its managers that Covid-19 is not included in the group\u2019s policy with the insurer Zurich and has advised them to consider seeking further cover elsewhere. Industry sources indicated that it appears likely the problem could be replicated in other sectors. UK supermarkets appeal for calm as shelves empty Read more In a letter sent to publicans last week, which has been seen by the Guardian, Ei said: \u201cIt has been confirmed that Zurich is not including Covid-19 in its notifiable diseases section. As such, any business affected by Covid-19 will not be able to claim for loss of trade.\u201d The move comes after many small-business owners had thought a problem with making insurance claims for coronavirus losses had been solved. Earlier this month, the government bowed to pressure by changing its stance on insurance to declare coronavirus as a \u201cnotifiable disease\u201d \u2013 a formal classification required by many insurance policies. However, many of these existing policies cite specific diseases that businesses can claim for. As coronavirus is so new, it is not included in most of the lists. A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said : \u201cA small number of businesses may have cover in place that will specifically provide for business interruption arising from notifiable diseases. However, this type of extension is not commonly included as standard. Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks and are therefore unlikely to provide cover for the effects of global pandemics like Covid-19.\u201d Viv English, who runs the Lansdown Arms in Lewes, Sussex, said: \u201cWe have no Premier League games and maybe a 20% to 30% hit on trade. I have been paying into the policy for almost 20 years, it is compulsory for us to have it [as an Ei tenant] and it is going to let us down just when we need it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a real hit and I already know I can\u2019t pay my VAT bill. We are now paying VAT [due from] December when it was Christmas and everything was fab. We are now thinking if it is better to close down for a few months and pick up then?\u201d Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk Last week, Rishi Sunak unveiled a range of moves in his first budget that were designed to assist pubs and other small businesses where trade is likely to be hit by the virus. The chancellor said he was also making big changes to the business rates paid by pubs this year, in an effort to insulate them from the economic effects of the coronavirus . Leisure businesses with a rateable value of less than \u00a351,000 will pay no rates for the next 12 months, while the \u201cpub discount\u201d given to bars with a rateable value of up to \u00a3100,000 will increase from \u00a31,000 to \u00a35,000 this year. A spokesman for Zurich said: \u201cZurich\u2019s cover for business interruption is fully aligned with the rest of the insurance market. We will always respond whenever one of our policies is triggered and are continuing to support our customers on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Topics Ei Group Insurance industry Food & drink industry Pubs Coronavirus outbreak Services sector Rishi Sunak news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story \u2018A slap in the face\u2019: pub landlords livid at lack of support by Sunak Publicans fear for future as chancellor\u2019s proposals offer nothing for traditional locals Published: 11 Jul 2020 \u2018A slap in the face\u2019: pub landlords livid at lack of support by Sunak Pizza Express closures take hospitality job losses to 17,000 Chain could shed up to 1,100 staff and close up to 70 of its 449 UK outlets as Covid-19 compound\u2019s sector deep problems Published: 4 Aug 2020 Pizza Express closures take hospitality job losses to 17,000 Rumours and threats: what happened when Covid-19 shut our pubs When a customer in a Somerset town tested positive, two local venues found themselves in the eye of a storm Published: 11 Jul 2020 Rumours and threats: what happened when Covid-19 shut our pubs Pizza Hut considers insolvency as Covid-19 crisis threatens jobs Restaurant chain, with 5,700 staff, still hopeful of reopening most of its 244 UK branches Published: 29 Jul 2020 Pizza Hut considers insolvency as Covid-19 crisis threatens jobs Greggs weighs up job cuts when furlough scheme ends Published: 28 Jul 2020 Greggs weighs up job cuts when furlough scheme ends Welsh restaurants and pubs could reopen indoors from August Published: 10 Jul 2020 Welsh restaurants and pubs could reopen indoors from August UK set to bring in strict new junk food rules including pre-9pm ad ban Published: 23 Jul 2020 UK set to bring in strict new junk food rules including pre-9pm ad ban Pubs warn of closure risk after alcohol VAT cut exemption Published: 8 Jul 2020 Pubs warn of closure risk after alcohol VAT cut exemption More more on this story Most popular Business Economics Banking Money Markets Project Syndicate B2B Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Yet that same day, shares of another Taiwanese\u00a0company jumped as\u00a0much as\u00a0their daily 10% limit, the most in almost five years.MediaTek Inc., a designer of chips used in electronics including smartphones,\u00a0has since climbed another 78% in Taiwan and by late July overtook the market value of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the Taipei-based flagship of iPhone maker Foxconn Technology Group. At the close of trade Wednesday, MediaTek\u00a0was Taiwan\u2019s second-biggest company, worth NT$1.2 trillion ($40 billion).\u00a0The\u00a0new rule from the Trump administration\u00a0stated that chip manufacturers such as TSMC\u00a0cannot use American know-how to make semiconductors for Huawei, accusing the Chinese company\u00a0of undertaking \u201cmalign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.\u201d Since U.S. equipment, software and materials are an irreplaceable part of chip manufacturing, the edict meant that\u00a0Huawei can no longer use its own chips in its devices.But Huawei\u2019s\u00a0smartphones, routers, switches and other hardware can use chips designed by outside parties, even if they\u2019re manufactured with American technology.\u00a0Enter MediaTek.It designs 5G chips for both smartphones and base stations, and has them manufactured by TSMC, making it the perfect replacement for the Huawei-designed chips that can no longer be made.Already a supplier to the Chinese company, MediaTek\u2019s orders from Huawei are reported to have jumped after the restrictions, spurring analysts to raise their outlook for 2020 revenue by 14% and for next year by 29%.This wasn\u2019t some fluke, though, or merely being in the right place at the right time. Founded by M.K. Tsai, a U.S.-educated electrical engineer and\u00a0 early leader\u00a0of Taiwan\u2019s chip industry,\u00a0MediaTek has made a career out of being the backup quarterback in the world\u2019s most ubiquitous devices.Once a division of United Microelectronics Corp., TSMC\u2019s smaller rival in the chip foundry business, the company was spun off and listed in 2001. All three are based in Taiwan\u2019s Hsinchu Science Park.\u00a0When it gained independence,\u00a0CD-ROMs and\u00a0DVDs were hot, and MediaTek made the chips which powered them. It\u2019s been riding the electronics revolution ever since and\u00a0Tsai was later named among the world\u2019s best-performing chief executive officers\u00a0by the Harvard Business Review.\u00a0When\u00a0Blu-ray players\u00a0were introduced, it became a key supplier of components. By the time Bluetooth\u00a0became standard in gadgets, later to include mobile phones, MediaTek had cheaper offerings than its rivals. Wi-Fi was another big boon to the company.In many cases, MediaTek didn\u2019t have the first or even the best product in the market, but it consistently found a way to balance performance with cost, and leverage a huge uptake in a hip new technology that would invariably\u00a0force prices down. Competitors were often left flat-footed, offering higher-priced chips when MediaTek\u2019s components were considered acceptable while being far cheaper.When mobile telephony came along, particularly the 3G technology that\u00a0enabled the mobile internet, MediaTek was recognized as a serious player. Before long, it was not only designing networking chips but the core processor that\u00a0runs a smartphone or tablet, treading on turf dominated by Qualcomm Inc. It went one step further, offering reference designs \u2014\u00a0recipes for how to make a smartphone \u2014\u00a0whereas Qualcomm tended to just sell the chip and let device manufacturers figure out the rest.MediaTek\u2019s semiconductors, and Google\u2019s free Android operating system, gave rise to a boom in smartphones that could be made for as little as $20 apiece. It has\u00a0since developed high-end chips with artificial intelligence\u00a0capabilities. One parlor trick: using MediaTek-powered phones to follow human movement and mimic it on a robot.Now, there\u2019s 5G.With Chinese smartphone\u00a0brands like Huawei, Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo already clients, and China itself being the earliest adopter of this faster networking standard, MediaTek stands poised to benefit. It helps that its closest rival, Qualcomm, is an American company in the midst of a U.S.-China tech cold war.Its new mobile chipsets may be installed on more than 40% of 5G\u00a0devices launched in China, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum writes, adding to the strength it already enjoys in the market for Wi-Fi and power-management components it supplies to the likes of Amazon.com Inc., Xiaomi\u00a0and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.MediaTek has built a good business from being a smaller, less-famous name from a little-known place in Taiwan. With\u00a0Beijing-Washington tensions heating up, it now finds itself at the center of the action.\u00a0The trick will be to remain indispensable without becoming collateral damage.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

Simply Wall St March 20, 2020 Unfortunately for some shareholders, the Barco ( EBR:BAR ) share price has dived 51% in the last thirty days. Even longer term holders have taken a real hit with the stock declining 18% in the last year. All else being equal, a share price drop should make a stock more attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that long term investors have an opportunity when expectations of a company are too low. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio. See our latest analysis for Barco How Does Barco\u2019s P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers? We can tell from its P/E ratio of 14.45 that there is some investor optimism about Barco. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (13.1) for companies in the electronic industry is lower than Barco\u2019s P/E. ENXTBR:BAR Price Estimation Relative to Market, March 20th 2020 That means that the market expects Barco will outperform other companies in its industry. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling . How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios Probably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the \u2018E\u2019 will be higher. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases. Barco increased earnings per share by a whopping 26% last year. And it has bolstered its earnings per share by 39% per year over the last five years. So we\u2019d generally expect it to have a relatively high P/E ratio. A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The Bank One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. That means it doesn\u2019t take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash). While growth expenditure doesn\u2019t always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores. Barco\u2019s Balance Sheet With net cash of \u20ac356m, Barco has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 26% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio. The Bottom Line On Barco\u2019s P/E Ratio Barco trades on a P/E ratio of 14.4, which is above its market average of 11.8. With cash in the bank the company has plenty of growth options \u2014 and it is already on the right track. So it does not seem strange that the P/E is above average. Given Barco\u2019s P/E ratio has declined from 29.7 to 14.4 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is significantly less confident about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for a contrarian, it may signal opportunity. Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is better than it expects, you can make money by buying and holding for the long term.

These two units are now being marketed\nfor sale both together or separately by deadline private\ntreaty through Bayleys Tauranga, closing on August 12.\nSalesperson James Ross said Holland Beckett Law had two\nleases on the property \u2013 reflecting its split tenancy\nacross the three floors. Both leases run\nsimultaneously through to 2025 and both with four further\nthree-year rights of renewal, with rent reviews every three\nyears.

Ross said numerous banks,\naccounting firms, law firms and other professional services\nentities have office premises along Cameron Road - taking\nadvantage of the high profile delivered from its four lanes,\nwhile simultaneously allowing for bountiful on-site\ncarparking facilities. \u201cThis stand-alone tenancy\nwill appeal to a broad range of buyers, from local investors\nto national portfolio holders,\u201d he\nsaid. \u00a9 Scoop Media Bayleys Real Estate New Zealand Bayleys is New Zealand's largest full-service real estate company.

Spain has had the biggest drop in output in the second quarter, with a GDP decline of 18.5%.\nPhotograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images The full extent of the impact of Covid-19 on the eurozone economy has been laid bare by figures showing the single currency zone shrank by a record 12.1% in the second quarter of 2020. Amid growing fears that Europe\u2019s tentative recovery is about to be affected by a second wave of the crisis, the European Union\u2019s statistical arm, Eurostat, provided stark evidence of the drop in activity caused by the almost total lockdowns imposed by some countries in the spring. Eurostat\u2019s data revealed that the contraction in the second quarter \u2013 when combined with a smaller fall in the first three months of the year \u2013 had wiped out a decade and a half of expansion, returning the eurozone economy to its level in the mid-2000s. Italy \u2013 which has struggled to grow since adopting the single currency \u2013 has seen its GDP return to the levels of the mid-1990s. In Spain, where concerns about a second wave are most acute, there has been the biggest drop in output in the second quarter, registering a decline in GDP of 18.5%. The fall, unmatched even during its civil war of the 1930s, followed a contraction of 5.2% in the first quarter and means that the eurozone\u2019s fourth-biggest economy shrank by almost a quarter in the first half of 2020. France, second in size only to Germany within the 19-nation single currency area, saw its GDP drop by 13.8%, while the next biggest economy, Italy, contracted by 12.4%. Germany , which reported its growth figures on Thursday, was the least bad performer of the eurozone\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d economies with a GDP contraction of 10.1% in the second quarter. The best performing countries in the eurozone were in eastern Europe and the Baltic states. Eurostat said that taken as a whole, the eurozone economy was 15% smaller than it had been a year earlier. The record-breaking drop in the April to June period of 2020 followed a fall of 3.6% in the first three months of the year and zero growth in the final quarter of 2019. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at the consultancy firm Capital Economics , said: \u201cThere are few silver linings in the data published today, which confirm that eurozone GDP slumped just as much as feared in the second quarter and that inflation remained well below target. While parts of the economy have sprung back to life over the past couple of months, the damage already done combined with the current and potential future impact of the virus mean that the recovery will be painfully slow.\u201d Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Despite the unprecedented drop in GDP in the second quarter, the worst of the economic damage from Covid-19 was caused in April and activity started to pick up in May and June as lockdown restrictions were eased. But analysts warned that full recovery would be a long process. \u201cThe hard part of this recovery is set to start about now,\u201d said Bert Colijn, senior Eurozone economist at ING Bank. \u201cFirst of all, slightly higher trending new Covid-19 cases increase the risk of reversed reopenings, and we\u2019re already seeing local signs of that. Secondly, from this point on, cautious increases in unemployment and bankruptcies and weak investment will bring to light more characteristics of a general economic slump.

Natural gas fuel specialist Clean Energy Fuels\u00a0(NASDAQ: CLNE) has been working for years to change that.  It took on a lot of debt to build \"America's Natural Gas Highway,\" lining a coast-to-coast route with natural gas filling stations and placing more in major urban centers to make it easier for trucking companies to switch their fleets to from diesel to natural gas. Bloomberg The World\u2019s Hottest Stock Is a Money-Losing Tech Giant Soaring 880% (Bloomberg) -- It gets far less attention than Tesla, the FAANGs or even the Robinhood flavor of the week.Yet Sea Ltd. has quietly become the world\u2019s best-performing large-cap stock, stoking a debate on Wall Street over whether the Singapore-based gaming, e-commerce and payments company is the next great internet colossus or just Exhibit A in a global tech bubble that\u2019s destined to burst.For now at least, bulls have the upper hand. Swelling optimism that loss-making Sea may one day become both the Tencent and Alibaba of Southeast Asia has boosted its New York-listed shares by more than 880% in the past 18 months, the largest gain worldwide among companies with a starting market value of at least $1 billion. Short sellers who placed record wagers against the stock in June are retreating at an unprecedented pace.If Sea Chief Executive Officer Forrest Li is paying attention to any of this, he\u2019s not letting on. The 42-year-old billionaire said in a video interview that he\u2019s been working seven-day weeks in the office since April, leading his company through what may be its most pivotal year. Demand for Sea\u2019s mobile games and online-shopping platform has surged during the pandemic, and the company is bidding on a Singapore digital-banking license to accelerate its push into financial services. Li is also looking for potential acquisitions in gaming, logistics and e-commerce.\u201cWe don\u2019t like to think too much about our success or how we got here,\u201d he said when asked about Sea\u2019s stock price. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the environment is good or bad. It doesn\u2019t change a company or a person.\u201dEven by the standards of today\u2019s tech boom, Li\u2019s ascent has been remarkable. Born in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, he worked for the local units of Motorola Solutions Inc. and Corning Inc. before enrolling in Stanford\u2019s MBA program. He founded Sea, then known as Garena, in 2009 and took it public with backing from Tencent in 2017.Read more about Li, who named himself after Forrest Gump.After a rocky first year of trading, Sea\u2019s stock has gone on to trounce everything in its class. Initially, the gains were fueled by the runaway success of Sea\u2019s first self-made mobile game -- a battle royale called Free Fire that has attracted as many as 80 million daily active users in more than 130 markets.But Sea\u2019s e-commerce and financial services units are now increasingly important pillars of the bull case. Its Shopee platform overtook Alibaba\u2019s Lazada in the fourth quarter of 2019 to become the top e-commerce provider in Southeast Asia, according to research firm iPrice, and the business accounted for more than 40% of Sea\u2019s revenue in 2019, up from 2.3% in 2017.SeaMoney, which offers everything from e-wallets to micro loans, could ultimately be just as large, according to Li. \u201cWe think this is a huge business opportunity,\u201d he said.Read more: Sea\u2019s Singapore Digital Bank Bid Targets Millennials, SMEsThe soft-spoken founder has some big-name believers. Tencent still owns about 20% of Sea, and the stock was the biggest holding as of May in Noah Blackstein\u2019s Dynamic Power Global Growth Class fund, one of the world\u2019s top-performing equity mutual funds of the past decade. Other prominent shareholders include Chase Coleman\u2019s Tiger Global Management LLC and Kora Management LP, an emerging markets-focused hedge fund in New York, according to regulatory filings as of March.Kora began investing in Sea in early 2018 after meeting with Li, Daniel Jacobs, the hedge fund\u2019s founding partner, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last two years a company that\u2019s got a great team and great products going after a big market and just executing incredibly well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think this is a mini Tencent and has the ability to be a really successful, large company in a global context.\u201dSea has already claimed the title of biggest company in Southeast Asia after its market value swelled to $65 billion, topping DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and PT Bank Central Asia for the first time earlier this year. Revenue has also grown quickly, jumping 163% to $2.2 billion in 2019, though it\u2019s still just a fraction of DBS\u2019s $11 billion.As for Sea\u2019s $1.46 billion net loss last year? Jacobs isn\u2019t bothered by it. \u201cThey are thoughtful and prudent about building a business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very much of the view that the company has all this under control.\u201dNot everyone is convinced.DBS Bank Ltd. analyst Sachin Mittal downgraded his recommendation on Sea to sell in July, citing Indonesia\u2019s new tax regulations for cross-border transactions and the likelihood of the company burning through cash to grow its payments business. \u201cThere is a tech bubble right now,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSea\u2019s stock is overvalued and it\u2019s partly a reflection of the industry.\u201dWhile short sellers have closed out bets against Sea at a rapid clip in recent weeks, they still have a bearish position worth more than $3 billion, or about 8% of the stock\u2019s free float, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. \u201cMark-to-market losses may have forced shorts out of their position,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at S3. \u201cBut they may still have a negative outlook.\u201dSkeptics note that Sea faces deep-pocketed competitors in all of its main businesses, from Lazada to Grab Holdings Inc. and a slew of other up-and-comers in digital finance. Meanwhile, Sea\u2019s gaming unit has yet to prove it\u2019s more than just a one-hit wonder.Read more: Alibaba Helps Asia\u2019s Malls Go Online After Virus Upends Retail\u201cWe could have a post-Covid situation where the jack-up in revenue does not materialize, and the gaming business is doing well but rests on only one popular game,\u201d said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer equity research at Tellimer Ltd.Sea optimists see little reason to cash in. In fact, Georg Krijgh, founder and head of the investment team at Amsterdam-based Fratres, said his firm\u2019s Knight Tech Fund, which has 150 million euros ($177 million) under management, plans to add to its Sea holdings.The stock is already the fund\u2019s second-largest position after Shopify Inc., a Canadian e-commerce company that has gained more than 500% in the past 18 months. \u201cThere are always people who like to short excellent companies such as Sea, Tesla or Carvana, mainly based on the argument of a high valuation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inferior strategy.\u201dSea\u2019s biggest challenge now may have less to do with execution than with meeting investors\u2019 \u201csky-high\u201d expectations, said Matthew Kanterman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In the past seven days alone, Sea\u2019s stock has soared 28% to record.For his part, Li appears well aware that the bar has increased. It\u2019s been hard not to notice with everyone calling his company a Southeast Asian mashup of Tencent and Alibaba, two of the most successful businesses in history.\u201cWe learned a lot from those pioneers,\u201d said Li, who has an estimated net worth of $7.5 billion. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we don\u2019t need to be their mini versions. We can just be ourselves.\u201dFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.

Simply Wall St August 4, 2020 Is Barco NV ( EBR:BAR ) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it\u2019s important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you\u2019ll find our analysis useful. Investors might not know much about Barco\u2019s dividend prospects, even though it has been paying dividends for the last nine years and offers a 2.3% yield. While the yield may not look too great, the relatively long payment history is interesting. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable. Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis ENXTBR:BAR Historic Dividend August 4th 2020 Payout ratios Dividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable \u2013 hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company\u2019s net income after tax. Barco paid out 53% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. A payout ratio above 50% generally implies a business is reaching maturity, although it is still possible to reinvest in the business or increase the dividend over time. We also measure dividends paid against a company\u2019s levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Barco paid out 505% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. Barco paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn\u2019t generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Barco to repeatedly pay dividends that aren\u2019t well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign. With a strong net cash balance, Barco investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective. Consider getting our latest analysis on Barco\u2019s financial position here. Dividend Volatility One of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well \u2013 nasty. The first recorded dividend for Barco, in the last decade, was nine years ago. The company has been paying a stable dividend for a while now, which is great. However we\u2019d prefer to see consistency for a few more years before giving it our full seal of approval. During the past nine-year period, the first annual payment was \u20ac0.1 in 2011, compared to \u20ac0.4 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 11% per year over this time. The dividend has been growing pretty quickly, which could be enough to get us interested even though the dividend history is relatively short. Further research may be warranted. Dividend Growth Potential Dividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. It\u2019s good to see Barco has been growing its earnings per share at 28% a year over the past five years. With recent, rapid earnings per share growth and a payout ratio of 53%, this business looks like an interesting prospect if earnings are reinvested effectively. Conclusion To summarise, shareholders should always check that Barco\u2019s dividends are affordable, that its dividend payments are relatively stable, and that it has decent prospects for growing its earnings and dividend. First, we think Barco has an acceptable payout ratio, although its dividend was not well covered by cashflow. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, although its dividend history is not as long as we\u2019d like. In sum, we find it hard to get excited about Barco from a dividend perspective. It\u2019s not that we think it\u2019s a bad business; just that there are other companies that perform better on these criteria. Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

To help outlets get back on their feet\nand encourage Kiwi consumers to support local, DB Breweries\nhas announced a million dollar support package, dubbed\n\u2018Back Your Bar\u2019.

Paul Millward, Sales Director, DB Breweries,\nknows this support is going to have a huge\nimpact: \u201cHospitality is a special industry where we\nall have amazing memories over the years. Incredible,\nhardworking owners and their staff put their hearts and\nsouls into these businesses and operating at Alert Level 2\nand beyond will not be easy. We wanted to help both the\nwider industry, and do a little extra for our customers, to\nhelp them survive now and thrive later. Bars need life so\nget out there and catch up with mates. \u201cDespite all\nthe new ways of connecting, nothing beats sitting down with\nreal people and having a meal you didn\u2019t have to cook with\na cold beer, so we hope Kiwis get behind Back Your Bar and\nsupport their local so they are there in the future.

There\nare two resource hubs on their website aimed at assisting\npeople with legal issues and providing information\nspecifically related to COVID-19 and what\u2019s to come for\nNew Zealand businesses. On top of this, DB hospitality\noutlets are able to access a complimentary 15-minute\ndiscussion with a lawyer from the firm regarding any\nCOVID-related legal issues. DB Breweries customers are\nset to benefit most from the initiative, with a range of\ncommercial support in the form of stock bundles and a point\nof sale suite. Julie White, Chief Executive Officer,\nHospitality New Zealand, is delighted with the support\npackage: \u201cThe hospitality industry is undoubtedly\none of the hardest hit as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDB\u2019s Back Your Bar initiative is a fantastic package to\nsupport the industry, ultimately helping to protect\nlivelihoods and keep this beloved part of our social fabric\noperating.

This can result in business disruptions and, potentially, financial losses. This may also lead to further detrimental consequences, ranging from a slowdown of a country\u2019s economic output to increased unemployment to financial market instability. [1] Since the Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016, 180+ parties [2] have committed to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy by enacting a variety of policies, such as the introduction or increase of a carbon tax penalizing firms operating in high CO 2 -emitting sectors. [3] These transition efforts will likely require an unprecedented level of investment over the next decades. This may contribute to the onset of a new type of financial risk that could have negative effects on a company\u2019s financial performance by eroding liquidity needed to service short- and long-term debt commitments. In the next few months, several major central banks and financial regulators across the world (e.g., US Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and European Central Bank) are planning to test the financial markets\u2019 preparedness for major physical and transition risks by introducing ad-hoc scenarios to financial institutions\u2019 annual stress-testing exercises. While scenario analysis is routinely performed by risk managers at financial institutions and non-financial corporations, energy transition risks pose new challenges, such as longer time horizons needed for the analysis, the lack of quality company emission data, and the lack of an established quantitative approach linking energy transition risks and opportunities to credit risk. [4] S&P Global Market Intelligence\u2019s Climate Linked Credit Analytics offers two innovative, automated tools that address these challenges. These tools can help financial practitioners analyse the impact of a pre-defined or user-defined carbon tax increase on a firm\u2019s creditworthiness, or across companies and entire portfolios. \u2022 The upstream Oil & Gas tool offers a fundamentals-driven view of how a future carbon tax increase may affect each financial item reported within company statements over the next three years. The tool, developed in consultation with Oliver & Wyman, [5] currently covers more than 1200+ [6] public and private companies operating in one of the most carbon-intensive sectors (i.e., the upstream Oil & Gas industry). Users can explore the impact of global carbon tax scenarios (where the carbon tax increases by a user-defined percentage across all countries) or the integrated scenarios generated via a global energy-economy-climate model (REMIND). [7] The estimated financials can then be run via Credit Analytics\u2019 CreditModel TM , a quantitative model generating a credit score. The score aims to statistically match S&P Global Ratings issuer credit ratings for rated companies, which can also be applied to unrated companies. [8] \u2022 The public firms tool offers a market-driven view of how earnings of public companies may change over the next three decades under multiple carbon tax scenarios. [9] The tool leverages Trucost\u2019s company-specific GHG emission data and accommodates pre-defined country and industry-specific carbon tax scenarios or user-defined global carbon tax scenarios. The tool calculates the change in credit score between today and a future year. These tools can help users perform stress-testing and scenario analysis, as well as comply with the Task Force for Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. These recommendations are expected to become mandatory over the next few years for the signatories of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). [10] The Materials Sector: Public Firms Tool Figure 1 shows the distribution of credit score changes between 2019 and 2050 for public companies within the Materials sector, one of the highest CO 2 -emitting sectors. We employ the public firms tool for a fast (i.e., two degrees Celsius) transition scenario, where the carbon tax rapidly increases and companies react in one of four ways: Yellow bars: Companies keep increasing carbon emissions and do not invest in new/greener technology, but pay carbon taxes on increased emissions. Green bars: Companies manage to meet CO 2 emission reduction targets in 2050 by investing in greener technology and, thus, sustaining abatement costs in addition to carbon tax costs. Revenues include both a growth component and a cost-related component. Amber bars: Companies maintain current (2019) levels of CO 2 emissions, saving on abatement costs, but sustaining carbon tax costs. Revenues grow only in proportion to the fraction of total costs passed on to customers. Red bars: Companies do not invest in new/greener technology and pay high carbon taxes, plus governments introduce additional policies that forcefully reduce carbon emissions (e.g., by progressively banning use of certain materials), thus leading to revenue losses on affected companies. Fig. 1: Distribution of credit score change between 2019 and 2050, for public companies in the Materials sector over a fast transition. Please, note the semi-logarithmic scale used to zoom into the y-axis. Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence. As of September 1, 2019. For illustrative purposes only. Despite some of these scenarios being quite extreme or unlikely, they are still useful to obtain a sense of the potential impact of company inaction or abrupt government policies in comparison to alternative, more rational choices. A few comments: 1. In all cases, a significant percentage of companies (up to 44%) remains with the same credit score under the fast transition. The remainder change their credit score in either direction, confirming the importance of managing risks, but also seizing opportunities over the long term. 2. In the yellow case (where emissions keep growing at a forecasted pace, and companies do not invest in new/greener technology), the distribution of score changes is skewed towards the left, due to the expected revenue growth. However, a significant number of companies may also be affected negatively, and up to 10% of firms in this sector may end up in a technical default (\u2018d\u2019) if their projected market capitalization falls to zero or to a negative value by 2050. This type of scenario essentially shows the cost of inaction by companies that simply bear carbon tax costs on increasingly higher carbon emissions. It is worth noting that the technical defaults reported here are a cumulative rate over the next 30 years. For comparison purposes, the long-term average cumulative (30-year) default rate of BBB-rated companies by S&P Global Ratings is higher than 10%. [11] 3. The green case shows the advantage of investing in new/greener technology, thus reducing carbon emissions and paying a lower carbon tax, while incurring higher operating costs on new technology. In this case, the vast majority of companies (71%) will experience an improvement in their credit scores by one or more notches, while 26% will remain with the same score, and only 1% will incur a technical (cumulative) default over the next 30 years. 4. The amber case assumes companies maintain current emission levels without converting to new technology, and will pay a hefty carbon tax (over the fast transition scenario), and increase their revenues only in proportion to the fraction of costs passed to their customers. This leads to a significant distribution skew towards the right-hand side of the graph, with 38% of companies at risk of technical default. 5. The red case corresponds to an extreme situation, where companies do not convert to new technology, but have to pay an increased carbon tax. This is while governments enforce restrictive laws to curb carbon emissions (e.g., by banning the use of obsolete technology or imposing carbon emission caps), and induce revenue losses among companies in proportion to the carbon emissions reduction. In this case, the technical (cumulative) default rate over the next 30 years increases to almost 79%, with potentially severe consequences for the Materials sector and the economy as a whole. This analysis shows the flexibility of the tool in accommodating various transition scenarios and firm behaviors, as well as the importance of striking a balance between carbon pricing policies and the actions that companies will need to take in order to adopt new technology and reduce carbon emissions. Finally, the public firms tool enables users to gauge the impact of a scenario for each individual company, rather than on a given sector. A detailed discussion at the company level will be covered in following work.

Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA The Casual Dining Group, which owns Bella Italia, warned this week it was headed into administration. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA Zoe Wood @ zoewoodguardian Published on Fri 22 May 2020 00.01 BST More than 30,000 pubs, bars and restaurants may remain permanently closed because the coronavirus shutdown has sent a wrecking ball through the UK\u2019s hospitality trade. The grim prediction follows a week in which the Casual Dining Group, which owns the Bella Italia and Caf\u00e9 Rouge restaurant chains, warned it was headed into administration \u2013 casting doubt over the future of its 250 restaurants. The enforced period of closure could be the final straw from some business operators who were having a tough time before the crisis hit. About 2,800 bars and restaurants closed down in the 12 months before the lockdown began. The 2.4% fall in the number of licensed premises in the year to the end of March was recorded by the CGA AlixPartners market recovery monitor, which now expects the decline to worsen once the hospitality sector begins to reopen at the start of July. Hospitality business owners expect the industry to reopen in stages but a third told CGA\u2019s latest business confidence survey they already anticipated the need to permanently close sites. CGA group chief executive Phil Tate said: \u201cIndustry estimates of the scale of closures vary widely, from below 10% to as high as 30% of total sites. The challenge for business owners will be to understand not just how long the casualty list will be, but which will be the worse hit areas and how individual sites will pivot to new styles of operation.\u201d Many pub operators have called for the two-metre distancing requirements to be relaxed, arguing they cannot be profitable at that distance and will therefore not reopen. The British Beer and Pub Association has said that the two-metre rule means that only one in five pubs will be able to restart, while one-metre distancing would allow most to reopen. A recent survey of BBPA members found that 19,000 out of the UK\u2019s 47,000 pubs believe they may be unable to reopen . Graeme Smith, the managing director at AlixPartners, said: \u201cMany operators have got their tape measures out to assess the impact of social distancing restrictions on operations and capacity. Even with well-configured space, cover counts will be meaningfully reduced and may prompt further questions on whether it is sensible to reopen, or not, from a profit perspective.\u201d Two-thirds of the UK\u2019s 115,108 licensed venues are independents, with the rest belonging to groups. The monitor figures point to the special vulnerability of casual dining restaurants. With many located in shopping centres and near office blocks, analysts think their trade may take longer to bounce back. A number of casual dining chains have already been forced into dramatic retrenchments after an investor-fuelled expansion boom ended in tears. Last year Jamie\u2019s Italian all but disappeared while the rescue deal being brokered for the Carluccio\u2019s Italian dining chain is expected to save just 30 of its 77 outlets. The report suggested that local pubs and restaurants which have also fallen out of favour \u2013 with community pub numbers declining 3.7% in the same period \u2013 could emerge as winners from the crisis as consumer points to the public\u2019s preference to return to local establishments before heading back to city and town centres.

Their wages have been stagnant or in decline for decades. Many no longer earn a living wage \u2013 if they still have a job \u2013 and their struggle has fed, if not sometimes sparked, the protests sweeping the U.S.Last week, the Business Roundtable urged Congress to pass another coronavirus bailout \u201cto alleviate the economic challenges millions of Americans are confronting,\u201d including \u201ctargeted aid to struggling individuals and families that offer relief while also encouraging a return to work.\u201d It has also issued statements recently about paid time off for voting, police reform and racial justice.Those are all worthy causes, but the group has done little about the one cause over which it has the most influence, if not outright control: workers\u2019 economic insecurity.It\u2019s an issue the Roundtable professes to care about. The group\u2019s revised \u201cStatement on the Purpose of a Corporation,\u201d released last summer and signed by 181 of its roughly 200 members, committed to serving all corporate stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers and communities. This was a strong break with the group\u2019s traditions, upending a decades-old orthodoxy that corporations exist primarily to serve shareholders. \u201cAmericans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity,\u201d the statement declared.What happens when hard work isn\u2019t enough? There are a number of handy calculators, such as MIT\u2019s and the Economic Policy Institute\u2019s, that peg a living wage for a family of four residing in a small town at roughly $60,000 to $70,000 a year. That figure is considerably higher for workers living in pricey cities. Now consider that the average full-time production and nonsupervisory worker at an S&P 500 company earned just $41,442 last year, according to data compiled by the AFL-CIO.It\u2019s not as if everyone in Corporate America is poorly compensated. Over the last decade, CEO pay at S&P 500 companies increased more than $340,000 a year to an average of $14.8 million in 2019, according to the AFL-CIO. Wages for average workers at those same companies over the same period of time rose just $836 a year. That disparity is even more glaring at companies that furloughed workers this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The CEO of Burlington Stores Inc., for example, earned $35 million in 2019; workers there earned a median wage of $11,583. The CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. was paid $17.8 million; the company\u2019s workers took home a median wage of $16,925.Let\u2019s look at one of the most admired corporate giants, Amazon.com Inc. Its median total compensation for full-time employees was $36,640 in 2019, according to the company\u2019s pay ratio disclosure. And Amazon\u2019s founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, is a prominent member of the Roundtable and signed its high-minded call to action last year.Amazon\u2019s workers take home even less than the company\u2019s median pay implies. Amazon annualizes compensation for employees who did not work the entire year without distinguishing between workers who left voluntarily and those who were laid off. It also includes the value of restricted stock the company grants them, which is typically worthless if workers don\u2019t stay with the company for a specified period and meet certain performance hurdles. Restricted stock is nice, but it doesn\u2019t put food on families\u2019 tables.Amazon is far from alone. Walmart Inc. CEO Doug McMillon is also a Roundtable member and signed last year\u2019s statement. The big-box retailer\u2019s median worker pay was just $22,484 in fiscal year 2020, according to the company. You can add Target Corp.\u2019s Brian Cornell, Marathon Petroleum Corp.\u2019s Michael Hennigan, Home Depot Inc.\u2019s Craig Menear and S&P Global Inc.\u2019s Douglas Peterson to the list of Roundtable members with struggling workers.If the Roundtable wants to make a difference, its members should pay their workers an adequate wage. Had it done so earlier, efforts by Congress and the White House to craft another bailout wouldn\u2019t be entangled by what we see as an irrelevant issue: wages.Legislators have let extended unemployment benefits lapse for America\u2019s workers, with Republicans arguing that an extension of $600 a week in aid is a disincentive to work. Yet one of the core goals of the bailout is to support about 21 million unemployed Americans so they can afford basic necessities while Covid-19 ravages the economy. The only reason that skinflints in Washington can complain about benefits being higher than wages is because wages in our country are at shameful, rock-bottom levels. As long as companies insist on paying workers less than a living wage, adequate assistance will necessarily amount to more money.A recent Yale University study found no evidence that people receiving higher unemployment payments were less likely to return to work. Nevertheless, Republicans have proposed reducing supplemental unemployment insurance to $200 a week through September, after which total unemployment benefits would be capped at 70% of lost wages. Again: 70% of an already sub-standard wage isn\u2019t adequate, particularly for workers in notoriously low-wage industries such as retail and hospitality that have been hardest hit by Covid-19.It\u2019s not clear what the Roundtable can do about many of the social and political issues it has weighed in on recently. But its members can pay their workers better wages. Those employees get up and go to work every day like everyone else, and most of them are still falling well short of earning an adequate living.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Nir Kaissar is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the markets.

Simply Wall St July 11, 2020 To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Firstly, we\u2019ll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it\u2019s a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, Barco ( EBR:BAR ) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital. What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)? If you haven\u2019t worked with ROCE before, it measures the \u2018return\u2019 (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Barco is: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities) 0.12 = \u20ac106m \u00f7 (\u20ac1.2b \u2013 \u20ac316m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2019) . So, Barco has an ROCE of 12%. In absolute terms, that\u2019s a satisfactory return, but compared to the Electronic industry average of 9.7% it\u2019s much better. See our latest analysis for Barco ENXTBR:BAR Return on Capital Employed July 11th 2020 Above you can the how the current ROCE for Barco\u2019s compares to it\u2019s prior returns on capital, but you can only tell so much from the past. If you\u2019d like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Barco here for free. What Can We Tell From Barco\u2019s ROCE Trend? Investors would be pleased with what\u2019s happening at Barco. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 12%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 30%. This can indicate that there\u2019s plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that\u2019s common among multi-baggers. In another part of our analysis, we noticed that the company\u2019s ratio of current liabilities to total assets decreased to 27%, which broadly means the business is relying less on its suppliers or short-term creditors to fund its operations. So this improvement in ROCE has come from the business\u2019 underlying economics, which is great to see. The Bottom Line On Barco\u2019s ROCE A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that\u2019s what Barco has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 177% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence. While Barco looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price.

Stocks have surged more than 40% since late March because the worst damage from the coronavirus recession is in the past and the cavalry has arrived. The Federal Reserve is now propping up risky assets, Congress is flooding the economy with money and some of the millions of lost jobs seem to be returning . But if you\u2019re an ordinary person who thinks the soaring stock market is crazy , you\u2019re right. There\u2019s no right or wrong value for any stock, or for the market as a whole. There\u2019s only the value the market assigns at any point in time, based on supply, demand and other factors. But demand for stocks\u2014investors placing buy orders\u2014is out of sync with what\u2019s happening in the real economy, where the unemployment rate has soared from 3.5% to 13.3% in just three months. Traders are right when they say the stock market evaluates the future, not the past. Backward-looking economic data about what happened last week or last month is irrelevant to the value of stocks unless it hints at future actions, such as an unexpected change in Federal Reserve policy. But it\u2019s hard to imagine what future stocks are evaluating right now. 2025? 2030? \u00a0If so, that\u2019s a time horizon so distant it\u2019s almost meaningless. Here are some of the grim developments economists foresee during the next 12 to 24 months: Massive small business failures. \u201c Very small businesses with just a few em\u00adployees are expected to fail en masse,\u201d Moody\u2019s Analytics says in a June 2 forecast . \u201cOf the 8 million busi\u00adness establishments operating prior to the crisis in the U.S., it would not be surprising if close to a million do not make it. New busi\u00adnesses will eventually form, and the economy will recover, but that process will take years, not months.\u201d Many of those small firms don\u2019t have the connection with banks needed to take advantage of federal aid. Commercial bankruptcy filings in May soared by 48% year over year, a preview of the carnage coming. Trillions in lost output. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the coronavirus recession will cost the U.S. economy $15.7 trillion in real economic output by 2030, adjusted for inflation, for a 5.3% drop in total output. That\u2019s 7 months\u2019 worth of economic activity that simply won\u2019t happen, which will suppress employment and incomes well into the decade. View photos The May jobs report showed an unexpected rise in non-farm payrolls (David Foster/Yahoo Finance) More A long and slow jobs recovery . IHS Markit thinks employment won\u2019t recover to pre-virus levels until 2024, even with the surprise addition of 2.5 million new jobs in May. Those May job gains reflect some furloughed workers returning in hammered industries such as travel and retail. But statistical anomalies in the government survey may have left some jobless workers uncounted. And employment can\u2019t recover fully until there\u2019s a coronavirus vaccine, which is probably a year away at the earliest. Congress, meanwhile, may decline to pass further stimulus measures, which many economists think are still needed. One month of upbeat job numbers could turn out to be a mirage. Debt crises. Governments everywhere are racking up debt to bail out companies and workers and keep the global recession from getting worse. At some point, serious doubts will rise about some countries\u2019 ability to make interest payments. It\u2019ll happen first in developing countries and then perhaps in Italy. Rising interest rates would be one ugly manifestation, pushing up borrowing costs for everybody. Bank stress. Many businesses that fail or restructure will default on debt owed to banks and other lenders. Banks aren\u2019t fragile and overleveraged as they were before the financial crash in 2008, but an unforeseen shock of the magnitude we\u2019re seeing now could bring down at least a few lenders. Story continues Investors clearly think the Fed and other central banks can corral these problems, and the Fed certainly has the power to massively intervene in the economy. What the Fed can\u2019t do, however, is create demand. That requires businesses and consumers to gain confidence that the coronavirus is gone for good, jobs are safe and it\u2019s okay to spend money. View photos In this March 3, 2020 file photo, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference to discuss an announcement from the Federal Open Market Committee, in Washington. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) More Most states are now easing stay-home restrictions meant to stop the spread of the virus, and economic activity is slowly bouncing back in some places . But job losses, business closures and lost spending are also causing structural damage to the economy that will take years to repair. Those lost jobs and businesses do matter to the stock market, because they impact profitability at many publicly held companies, and solvency at a few of them. But the power of the Fed outweighs all of that , or at least investors think it does. \u201cUnprecedented support from central banks has helped prevent the vast economic shock caused by the virus from morphing into a financial crisis,\u201d Capital Economics explained to clients on June 4. \u201cWe think that many risky assets could keep outperforming.\u201d So a buoyant stock market makes no sense in relation to the devastation occurring in the real world. But it makes perfect sense given the Fed and other central banks are pushing stocks up, to rebuild confidence in one slice of the economy. Whether you\u2019re incredulous at the stock market\u2019s performance, or cheering it on, you\u2019re right.

COVID-19 Pandemic Likely To Cause US Telemedicine Boom 1 Jul, 2020 US companies hoarding cash seen dragging on recovery until coronavirus beaten Author Peter Brennan Theme Real Estate Technology, Media & Telecom Fintech Macroeconomics The Dash for Cash: This story is the third of a three-part series examining the changing shape of company balance sheets in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Don't rely on companies to drag the U.S. economy out of its coronavirus-induced slump. The Dash for Cash Part 1: Weakest US companies led dash for cash as coronavirus came over the horizon Part 2: Prudence pays as cash-rich US companies outperform peers in 2020 Part 3: US companies hoarding cash seen dragging on recovery until coronavirus beaten After U.S. companies built up their cash buffers to multiyear highs to guard against pandemic-related uncertainty, capital expenditure \u2014 the second-largest chunk of the U.S. economy after consumer spending \u2014 is predicted to suffer, acting as a drag on the recovery. Cash ratios \u2014 a measure of liquidity calculated by dividing total cash or cash equivalents by current liabilities \u2014 among S&P 500 members jumped to 17.1% in the first quarter from 13.8% at the end of last year as companies increased their cash holdings by $250 billion to a record $1.8 trillion, according to calculations by S&P Global Market Intelligence and S&P Dow Jones Indices. U.S. companies have been carrying more cash ever since the global financial crisis of 2008 as CFOs remained wary of future shocks. Now, analysts are pondering the long-term effects on company balance sheets of this unprecedented economic trauma. \"[Cash ratios] will stay like this for some time particularly while the virus is still out there and the threat of an extended first wave or second wave are very much a risk,\" Toby Gibb, head of investment directing, equities at Fidelity International, said in an interview. \"Until there is a vaccine, the risk is very much there that we could go back to lockdowns and that cash flow could be switched off.\" There is evidence that the shift has already started, compounded by a slump in demand and disruptions to supply chains. Demand for core durable goods \u2014 a key indicator of capital expenditure in the manufacturing sector that excludes fluctuating goods such as aircraft \u2014 slumped in April, with new orders down 6.5% month on month from $65.61 billion to $61.34 billion, a three-year low and the sharpest month-on-month decline since April 2010. Shipments fell 6.2% from $65.3 billion to $61.25 billion in April, the sharpest decline since January 2009. There was a rebound of sorts in May with orders and shipments increasing by 2.3% and 1.8%, respectively, but levels remain well below the pre-pandemic normal. By pumping trillions of dollars into financial markets, the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury have effectively supported liquidity, allowing companies access to cheap credit. However, there are doubts as to how long that support will be there and whether borrowing will become more expensive. Lawmakers are sparring over what measures to include in a second stimulus package and the Federal Reserve's $600 billion Main Street lending program is yet to disburse any payments. \"Main street program interest rates are too high,\" Simon MacAdam, senior global economist at Capital Economics, said in an interview . \"There has been poor take up in some government schemes so there are some question marks of access to funds if cash ratios do fall.\" Rather than rely on government largess, companies have been hitting debt markets like never before to buff up their balance sheets. Investment grade companies borrowed a record $1.129 trillion in the bond market in the first six months of 2020 while their speculative-grade peers raised an all-time high $210.6 billion, according to LCD, an offering of S&P Global Market Intelligence. \"In the short term it's still liquidity that is the concern,\" MacAdam said. \"[The] medium-term concern is whether that holds back the recovery because, rather than funding capex, they're just concerned about multiple waves.\" While there are estimated to be around 100 vaccines in development with a number in human trials, the earliest that one is likely to be widely available is in 2021, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The danger for the economy is that the decision to hoard cash and not invest becomes self-fulling, said Neil Richardson, investment director at Aberdeen Standard. \"If corporate confidence is low and they don't invest then it will produce low growth, which will make them think they were correct not to invest,\" he said in an interview. Declining capex U.S. companies have been investing less for decades, in many cases juicing valuations with dividends and buybacks instead. Capex as a percentage of GDP was 21% in 2018, down from over 25% in the mid-1980s, according to the World Bank. However, the pandemic may change that equation as companies shift priorities in the new reality, according to Fidelity's Gibb. \"We've been in a period for a long period of time where companies haven't been investing, they've been using their cash flow either to pay dividends or buyback their own shares,\" Gibb said. \"At the least maintenance capex and a degree of growth capex will remain. I think some companies see this as an opportunity to reset the bar from a dividends perspective.\" Author Peter Brennan Theme Real Estate Technology, Media & Telecom Fintech Macroeconomics About Us Quality Program Contact Us Email Subscription Center Press Releases Careers Corporate Responsibility Our History Investor Relations Leadership \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Terms of Use Cookie Notice Privacy Policy Disclosures Do Not Sell My Personal Information"},

Photograph: Lenscap/Alamy Wispa Gold is among the products to be brought under 200 calories when sold in multipacks. Photograph: Lenscap/Alamy Zoe Wood @ zoewoodguardian Published on Fri 17 Jul 2020 00.01 BST Cadbury is shrinking the size of Double Decker and Wispa Gold bars sold in multipacks so they contain less than 200 calories in an attempt to help tackle obesity, but the smaller bars will cost the same. Cadbury, owned by the US confectionery group Mondel\u0113z International, said multipacks accounted for the biggest slice of its chocolate sales and the change would eliminate 10bn calories from the UK market in one fell swoop. The company said it was offering more portion control options by voluntarily committing to bring all Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks under 200 calories by the end of 2021. The list of products being reduced in size includes Wispa Gold, Double Decker, Boost and Bournville Classic. However, there will be no change to the size of the bars sold individually. A spokesperson for Cadbury said: \u201cThe list price for these products will not be changing at this time. Retail pricing remains at the retailer\u2019s sole discretion.\u201d The practice of reducing product sizes but maintaining prices effectively increases their cost per ounce and is known as \u201cshrinkflation\u201d. The confectionery group has already promised to reduce the serving size of treats typically bought for children to under 100 calories by the end of this year with Fudge, Curly Wurly and Chomp bars among those to have already made the switch. Louise Stigant, the UK managing director at Mondel\u0113z International, said: \u201cWe recognise we must play our part in tackling obesity and are committed to doing so without compromising on consumer choice. A focus on portion control is recognised as one of the most effective ways of helping people balance their calorie intake.\u201d Measures to try and nudge the public into healthier food-buying habits are among policies being considered, in what has been billed a \u201cwar against obesity\u201d, being drawn up by Downing Street. Last week it was suggested that supermarkets in England could be stopped from placing chocolate and sweets as impulse purchases at the end of aisles. Cadbury has been reducing its portion sizes for several years, having introduced a 250-calorie cap on all single-serve chocolate bars in 2014 and a 98-calorie Cadbury Dairy Milk bar. Last year, the company launched Dairy Milk bars with 30% less sugar .

The Brewers Room\nopens in mid-July in Ponsonby Central and will bring with it\nsome 24 taps pouring fresh New Zealand brewed craft beers\nfrom breweries such as Epic, Garage Project, Behemoth,\nLiberty, Sawmill, Double Vision, McLeod\u2019s, and\nHeyDay. The Brewers Room is the creation of\nlong-standing Auckland hospitality operator Rolly Doyle who\nhas established and run such well-known entities as The\nBrewer\u2019s Co-operative and The Bluestone Room in the\nCBD. \u201cThere are a smattering of bars in Ponsonby\nwhich stock the occasional token Kiwi craft beer on their\nbeverage list, but none which are totally devoted to pouring\nthe extensive range of fresh craft beers on tap which The\nBrewers Room will have,\u201d said Rolly Doyle. \u201cOur\ncommitment to \u2018Kiwi-made\u2019 has become even more important\nas we enter the new mindset of \u2018buy local\u2019 as a result\nof Covid-19 where we have all been encouraged to buy New\nZealand products made by New Zealand-owned companies. And\nthings don\u2019t come much more Kiwi than our own craft\nbeers. \u201cThe emphasis will be on pouring fresh craft\nbeer. There will also be a constantly changing range of\nbeers. For example, our sister venue The Brewer\u2019s\nCo-operative has poured 1000 different varieties of beer\nover the past four years\u2026. and we\u2019re confident The\nBrewers Room will exceed that tally in an even shorter time\nframe. \u201cWhat that all means is that The Brewers Room\nmay be one of the few privileged bars in Auckland to receive\na keg of an experimental or limited release beer. But our\nallocation may be limited to one or two kegs\u2026 so when that\nbeer is gone, that\u2019s it. \u201cThat\u2019s the attraction\nof a craft beer bar. The tap selection is constantly\nchanging on an almost weekly basis\u2026 and as a result the\nbeer is always fresh. It\u2019s like Forrest Gump said in the\nmovie\u2026 \u2018life is like a box of chocolates\u2019 in that you\nare always presented with a surprise when you come in for a\npint. \u201cWe could be called \u2018Ponsonby\u2019s candy shop\nfor beer\u2019 where everyone from craft beer novices through\nto hard-core hop heads come in and look at the selection\nboard to see what\u2019s on offer.\u201d With no allegiance\nto any of New Zealand\u2019s \u2018big commercial breweries\u2019,\nThe Brewers Room is what is known in the hospitality\nindustry as a \u2018freehouse\u2019. \u201cA \u2018freehouse\u2019 is\na pub or bar devoid of any commitment to the corporate\nbrands of New Zealand- labelled beer brands which are now\nowned by foreign breweries. Again, it\u2019s all about buying\nlocal and supporting New Zealand companies,\u201d said Rolly\nDoyle. Packed with flavours and tastes created by\ngenerous use of malts and hops, modern New Zealand craft\nbeers such as those being served at The Brewers Room are\ntypically higher in alcohol levels than the bland\nmass-produced mainstream lagers which have prevailed in New\nZealand\u2019s hospitality scene for a generation. \u201cAs\npart of the whole craft beer experience, The Brewers Room\nwill be serving beers in tasting paddles \u2013 a row of small\nglasses which will allow customers the chance to sample\ntaste five individual different pours. That way they can\ntrial a variety of brands they may be unsure of \u2013 if they\nlike a particular pour, they can then go on and buy a pint,\nif not, then they haven\u2019t wasted their time and money on\nbuying an full serving,\u201d said Rolly Doyle. Dining at\nThe Brewers Room will be very much along the lines of a\n\u2018Kiwi fish and chip menu with a difference\u2019\u2013 with the\nvenue partnering up with leading Kiwi sauce-maker Culley\u2019s\nto flavour a range of slow-smoked or bbq meats, and a\nselection of chips and fries to soak up the accompanying\nales, along with the New Zealand\u2019s classic fare of fish\nand chips served in newsprint paper\u2026 all of which have\nhelped make sister venue The Brewer\u2019s Co-operative a\nlegendary hospitality location. The Brewers Room\u2019s\ndecor features tiled and wood-panelled walls, a rustic tin\nceiling, classic Kiwiana and beer-themed artworks and\nmemorabilia, and substantial cedar bi-fold doors opening up\nonto one of Ponsonby Central\u2019s internal alley ways. With\nplenty of leather booth seating around the perimeter and bar\nleaners and stools on the main bar floor area, The Brewers\nRoom\u2019s fi-out is designed to create a convivial and warm\ndrinking and dining environment. \u201cCraft beer is all\nabout the art of good conversation, and we wanted to create\nan ambience at The Brewers Room which wholeheartedly\nengendered that social interaction. So there\u2019s no pokie\nmachines and no dance floor. It\u2019s all about the pints, the\nfood, and the banter.\u201d In further support of New\nZealand\u2019s craft brewing industry, The Brewers Room is\nalready signed up to participate in Auckland Brewers Week\nnext month \u2013 hosting a scintillating Culley\u2019s sauces\nmeets Epic Brewing food and beer matching night on August 4\nto challenge the taste\nbuds. \u00a9 Scoop Media Join the Scoop Citizen Community 20 years of independent publishing is a milestone, but your support is essential to keep Scoop thriving.

According to S&P Global Ratings research, [1] the disruption to the global supply chain will be another critical factor that will weigh on the creditworthiness of some sectors. This disruption will be evidenced by reductions in worldwide import and export volumes, alongside diminishing financial performance of firms and the market\u2019s negative sentiment\u00a0towards some private and public companies. To understand the implications of COVID-19 on supply chains, we have used shipping data and supply chain intelligence from Panjiva, part of S&P Global. We have also used our Probability of Default Market Signals (PDMS) model, which incorporates stock price and asset volatility to calculate a one-year probability of default (PD). This will capture the more immediate market shocks from COVID-19, and enable us to assess the industries and companies that have experienced material changes to their default risk. In addition, our fundamentals-based CreditModel\u2122 is used to gauge if the mid- to long-term credit risk of these companies has changed significantly. Industry Trends As reported by Panjiva research, [2] U.S. imports have slowed in key areas across the Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and Materials sectors. This research looked at these downturns across several product areas and found that Furnishings had the greatest reduction in the first quarter of 2020, followed by Apparel, Iron & Steel, Machinery/Electronics (Industrial and Consumer Equipment), and Chemicals. By generating median PDMS scores at the industry level globally, as shown in Figure 1 below, we have a view of how recent market conditions have impacted the default risk for some industries identified by Panjiva as having the greatest reduction in seaborne U.S. imports. [3] The subset of industries within Consumer Discretionary are exhibiting the greatest increase in default risk/ deterioration in credit quality, and the highest overall\u00a0 PDs a key driver being investors\u2019 concerns that non-essential spending will be severely curtailed. Not surprising, auto manufacturers consistently demonstrated PDs that were higher than the other industries, with a PD at the beginning of April 2020 that was more than 20%. This is partially due to a reduced supply of parts, production disruptions, slumping sales, and falling market optimism as a result of COVID-19.\u00a0 Consumer Electronics (a sub-industry that excludes personal computing) also saw a steep rise in risk, increasing more than seven fold from 2.138% to 14.125% between January 1, 2020 and March 23, 2020, while Home Furnishings had the second highest overall PD throughout April 2020. Chemicals saw the lowest PDMS levels given the strong demand for a subset of critical chemical products, such as pharmaceutical active ingredients, disinfectant gels, personal health, and household products in the current pandemic. Figure 1: PDMS evolution in industries with highest import reduction Source: S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. We can identify these trends since PDMS is an early warning indicator gauged through market estimations of company performance and influenced by falling demand/disruption in the supply chain.\u00a0 Intuitively we can understand this, as reduced imports can be a result of falling demand. Additionally, the restricted supply of parts, materials, and other products will limit an importer\u2019s ability to maintain its output levels. These scenarios could lead to increased default risk. That is not to say that an industry that exhibits higher default risk is necessarily experiencing supply chain related issues as well, as we know that there are many factors that can affect the riskiness of companies within an industry. It is also worth mentioning that PDMS will react to market changes more quickly than import shipping volumes, which, in many cases, will be consigned months in advance. Company Analysis Taking the Consumer Electronics industry as one that has exhibited elevated default risk, we focus on two companies within that industry (Garmin Ltd. And SONOS,Inc.), using Panjiva data to get a more granular view on their supply chain risk, and PDMS to understand the default risk associated with COVID-19. As seen below in Figure 2, Sonos experienced a 45% year-over-year (y-o-y) fall in its associated import volume, from 107 TEU\u2019s [4] to 58 TEU\u2019s in February 2020. This was partially due to reduced demand and the U.S.-China trade tariffs, with approximately 84% of its seaborne imports traditionally coming from China. This y-o-y fall was reduced to 18% in March 2020 but rose again to 50% in April 2020 despite remaining relatively stable from the previous month. With COVID-19 affecting global supply lines, however, the monthly trend could well worsen and y-o-y fall continue. The PDMS for the firm was more risky than its median Consumer Electronics benchmark (in red) from March 2020 onwards. On March 16, 2020 the PDMS was more than 150% higher than the benchmark at 25.9% and 9.9%, respectively, the company\u2019s worst level in this recent period. Imports associated with Garmin Ltd. (Garmin) saw a large y-o-y fall in import volume, declining by 55%, 49% and 75% in February, March and April respectively. However, in absolute terms the fall in import volume over the 6 months from November 2019 to April 2020 was much larger for Sonos than for Garmin. [5] The PDMS for Garmin also remained consistently better than the median Consumer Electronics PD for the past 10 years, and from January 1, 2019 to March, 1 2020 remained below 1%. Despite showing some escalation since March, the company\u2019s PD was still outperforming the peer benchmark by more than 300% on March 23, 2020 [6] and continued to be better than the benchmark throughout April. Sonos would then appear to be more vulnerable from a credit risk standpoint and has seen more impact to its seaborne supply chain.

S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Supply Chain Analysis Understanding where a company\u2019s critical supplies are coming from and the creditworthiness of those suppliers can be essential to assessing the health of that company. Depending on how integral a supplier is to the company, a sudden reduction in supplies can transmit operational and financial stress, especially if the company cannot find an alternative supplier before current inventory is fully depleted. Using Panjiva data, we see that Sonos has more than 100 companies in its supply chain. In Figure 3 below, we show a simple snapshot of some of the firm\u2019s largest suppliers. Figure 3: Sonos\u2019 key suppliers and buyers S&P Global Market Intelligence, Panjiva as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. In Figure 4, we look at the export volume associated with one of Sonos\u2019s biggest suppliers, Wistron Corporation, a Taiwan-based provider of technology hardware with significant production capacity in China. It is clear that seaborne export volume peaked in December 2019 at 172 TEU\u2019s, but has been falling since January 2020, ending at 35 TEU\u2019s in March 2020 and seeming to continue the downward trend in April [7] . The U.S.-China trade war dramatically increased the cost of its exports, with the firm being further impacted by COVID-19 supply chain disruptions from the lockdown. Wistron now says it could move more than half of its production capacity outside of China. [8] Figure 4: Seaborne export volume \u2013 Wistron Corporation S&P Global Market Intelligence, Panjiva as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Figure 5 shows that the early warning signals revealed a sharp worsening of the PDMS from the beginning of March to March 23, 2020. However, from late March onwards there were some improvements as Wistron reported positive earnings results, implemented a share buyback scheme, and increased i's dividends. Despite this, the PDMS was still marginally worse than the industry median benchmark on May 1, 2020, due to the COVID-19 market pressures reducing demand and supply capacity, coupled with the negative market outlook. Figure 5: PDMS performance for Wistron Corporation S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For illustrative purposes only. Using CreditModel to assess the mid- to long-term credit strength of Wistron, and perhaps its ability to withstand COVID-19 related business pressures, gives a more positive impression of the long-term creditworthiness of the business. Although this has not yet been factored into its first quarter 2020 financials, Figure 6 shows that in fiscal quarter (FQ) 2019, the second, third, and fourth quarters were consistently displaying a bbb- credit score, which is a notch improvement from the first FQ 2019 at bb+. In addition, the company was outperforming the CreditModel median industry benchmark. We also know from Panjiva data that Wistron is a manufacturing partner for a number of very large companies, including Apple, Lenovo, and Microsoft. This should re-enforce the value of the firm and, perhaps, limit some concerns. However, from a supply chain perspective, their potentially large project to relocate significant production capacity and the trajectory of export volumes will be observed with keen interest. Figure 6: Long-term creditworthiness of Wistron Corporation using CreditModel S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For Illustrative purposes only. Scenario Analysis The overall credit strength of a company plays a crucial role in its resilience to market shocks, such as those presented by COVID-19. Even prior to a company releasing its quarterly financials, we can simulate what the possible impact might be to their creditworthiness. To illustrate this using CreditModel, [9] we ran a stressed scenario of a one-year decline of 50% in revenues and cash flow for both an Investment Grade and Speculative Grade entity.\u00a0 In Figure 7, we assume the company has a credit score of bbb-. After making these revenue and cashflow adjustments, the new score represented by the orange bar remains at the same level (bbb-). This impact is entity specific but, providing that the company continues to make a profit and there is not too much degradation in the other model drivers, it will see a moderate PD of 0.22% Figure 7: Reduction of revenue and cash flow in a company with a CreditModel score of bbb- S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For Illustrative purposes only. In the example below we make the same adjustment to a company with a credit score of bb-\u00a0 this company which was already experiencing a slight increase in its PD had a deterioration by one notch to b+ (or in PD terms from 1.06% to 2.16%) represented by the orange bar. If this company were impacted by COVID-19 in this way, then it would become much more difficult for it to manage its debt obligations. This supports the view that Investment Grade companies are expected to be more resilient than Speculative companies during an economic downturn. Figure 8: Reduction of revenue and cash flow in a company with a CreditModel score of bb- S&P Global Market Intelligence, PDMS as of May 4, 2020. For Illustrative purposes only. Summary COVID-19 and the resulting government mandated lockdowns have severely disrupted supply chains and increased the default risk across many industries. Amongst the subset of industries exhibiting high supply chain pressure, Automobile Manufacturers showed a particularly high vulnerability. This was also seen to a lesser extent in other parts of the Consumer Discretionary sector, such as Consumer Electronics. By analysing two Consumer Electronics companies, we were able to use Panjiva data to understand their import behaviour and identify critical companies within their supply chain. By utilising Credit Analytics, we can assess which suppliers were most vulnerable. Finally, using a simple scenario with CreditModel, we were able to illustrate the importance of a primary company\u2019s creditworthiness, or its suppliers\u2019, in its ability to withstand adverse market conditions.

That number need not have been so high. At the time of writing, the numbers are 351,000 and 15,000 respectively . Our research did not use any complicated model with a vast number of variables, no more than someone watching an avalanche heading in their direction calls for complicated statistical models to see if they need to get out of the way. We called for a simple exercise of the precautionary principle in a domain where it mattered: interconnected complex systems have some attributes that allow some things to cascade out of control, delivering extreme outcomes. Enact robust measures that would have been, at the time, of small cost: constrain mobility . Immediately. Later, we invoked a rapid investment in preparedness: tests, hospital capacity, means to treat patients. Just in case, you know. Things can happen. The error in the UK is on two levels. Modelling and policymaking. First, at the modelling level, the government relied at all stages on epidemiological models that were designed to show us roughly what happens when a preselected set of actions are made, and not what we should make happen, and how. The modellers use hypotheses/assumptions, which they then feed into models, and use to draw conclusions and make policy recommendations. Critically, they do not produce an error rate. What if these assumptions are wrong? Have they been tested? The answer is often no. For academic papers, this is fine. Flawed theories can provoke discussion. Risk management \u2013 like wisdom \u2013 requires robustness in models. But if we base our pandemic response plans on flawed academic models, people die. And they will. This was the case with the disastrous \u201c herd immunity \u201d thesis. The idea behind herd immunity was that the outbreak would stop if enough people got sick and gained immunity. Once a critical mass of young people gained immunity, so the epidemiological modellers told us, vulnerable populations (old and sick people) would be protected. Of course, this idea was nothing more than a dressed-up version of the \u201cjust do nothing\u201d approach. Individuals and scientists around the world immediately pointed out the obvious flaws : there\u2019s no way to ensure only young people get infected; you need 60-70% of the population to be infected and recover to have a shot at herd immunity, and there aren\u2019t that many young and healthy people in the UK, or anywhere. Moreover, many young people have severe cases of the disease, overloading healthcare systems, and a not-so-small number of them die. It is not a free ride. This doesn\u2019t even include the possibility, already suspected in some cases, of re ccurrence of the disease . Immunity may not even be reliable for this virus. Worse, it did not take into account that the duration of hospitalisation can be lengthier than they think, or that one can incur a shortage of hospital beds . Second, but more grave, is the policymaking. No 10 appears to be enamoured with \u201cscientism\u201d \u2013 things that have the cosmetic attributes of science but without its rigour. This manifests itself in the nudge group that engages in experimenting with UK citizens or applying methods from behavioural economics that fail to work outside the university \u2013 yet patronise citizens as an insult to their ancestral wisdom and risk-perception apparatus. Social science is in a \u201creplication crisis\u201d, where less than half the results replicate (under exact same conditions), less than a tenth can be taken seriously, and less than a hundredth translate into the real world. So what is called \u201cevidence-based\u201d methods have a dire track record and are pretty much evidence-free. This scientism also manifests itself in Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings\u2019s love of complexity and complex systems (our speciality) which he appears to apply incorrectly. And letting a segment of the population die for the sake of the economy is a false dichotomy \u2013 aside from the moral repugnance of the idea. As we said, when one deals with deep uncertainty, both governance and precaution require us to hedge for the worst. While risk-taking is a business that is left to individuals, collective safety and systemic risk are the business of the state. Failing that mandate of prudence by gambling with the lives of citizens is a professional wrongdoing that extends beyond academic mistake; it is a violation of the ethics of governing. The obvious policy left now is a lockdown, with overactive testing and contact tracing: follow the evidence from China and South Korea rather than thousands of error-prone computer codes. So we have wasted weeks, and ones that matter with a multiplicative threat. \u2022 Nassim Nicholas Taleb is distinguished professor of risk engineering at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering and author of The Black Swan.

Simply Wall St July 15, 2020 Broadly speaking, profitable businesses are less risky than unprofitable ones. Having said that, sometimes statutory profit levels are not a good guide to ongoing profitability, because some short term one-off factor has impacted profit levels. Today we\u2019ll focus on whether this year\u2019s statutory profits are a good guide to understanding Brand Architekts Group (LON:BAR). We like the fact that Brand Architekts Group made a profit of UK\u00a3793.0k on its revenue of UK\u00a317.8m, in the last year. Below, you can see that both its revenue and its profit have fallen over the last three years. See our latest analysis for Brand Architekts Group AIM:BAR Earnings and Revenue History July 15th 2020 Not all profits are equal, and we can learn more about the nature of a company\u2019s past profitability by diving deeper into the financial statements. Therefore, we think it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at Brand Architekts Group\u2019s cashflow, as well as examining the impact that unusual items have had on its reported profit. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. A Closer Look At Brand Architekts Group\u2019s Earnings One key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio . The accrual ratio subtracts the FCF from the profit for a given period, and divides the result by the average operating assets of the company over that time. This ratio tells us how much of a company\u2019s profit is not backed by free cashflow. That means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. While it\u2019s not a problem to have a positive accrual ratio, indicating a certain level of non-cash profits, a high accrual ratio is arguably a bad thing, because it indicates paper profits are not matched by cash flow. That\u2019s because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth. Over the twelve months to January 2020, Brand Architekts Group recorded an accrual ratio of 0.49. As a general rule, that bodes poorly for future profitability. To wit, the company did not generate one whit of free cashflow in that time. Over the last year it actually had negative free cash flow of UK\u00a39.9m, in contrast to the aforementioned profit of UK\u00a3793.0k. We saw that FCF was UK\u00a3205k a year ago though, so Brand Architekts Group has at least been able to generate positive FCF in the past. Having said that, there is more to the story. The accrual ratio is reflecting the impact of unusual items on statutory profit, at least in part. How Do Unusual Items Influence Profit? Brand Architekts Group\u2019s profit suffered from unusual items, which reduced profit by UK\u00a3251.0k in the last twelve months. In the case where this was a non-cash charge it would have made it easier to have high cash conversion, so it\u2019s surprising that the accrual ratio tells a different story. It\u2019s never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And, after all, that\u2019s exactly what the accounting terminology implies. If Brand Architekts Group doesn\u2019t see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we\u2019d expect its profit to increase over the coming year. Our Take On Brand Architekts Group\u2019s Profit Performance In conclusion, Brand Architekts Group\u2019s accrual ratio suggests that its statutory earnings are not backed by cash flow, even though unusual items weighed on profit. Having considered these factors, we don\u2019t think Brand Architekts Group\u2019s statutory profits give an overly harsh view of the business.

The Frankton Hotel in the Hamilton central\ncity-fringe industrial suburb of Frankton sits near a site\nfirst occupied by The Railway Hotel built in 1878. The\nRailway Hotel burnt down in 1885 and was replaced with what\nhas gone on to become the Frankton Hotel. The hotel was\noriginally located directly opposite what was Frankton\nJunction station until the depot was relocated several\nhundred metres west in the 1930s. Continuously modified\nand expanded over the ensuing decades, the current Art Deco\nstyled Frankton Hotel structure was completed in 1929, with\nminor alterations and extensions made in 1943, 1956, and the\n1970s. The land and buildings are owned by former All Black\nfront rower Graham \u2018Moose\u2019 Whiting who played 31 matches\nfor the ABs in the early 1970s. The historic pub overlooks\nHamilton\u2019s railway lines and sidings - part of the main\ntrunk line linking Auckland with the Central North Island\nand Wellington routes. Since the turn of the last century,\nthe main trunk rail line running through Frankton has been\nthe spine for freight movements around the North Island \u2013\ntransporting primary produce such as sheep and beef meat\nbutchered at the Horotiu freezing works, logs from the\nCentral North Island forests, and coal from the Huntly\nmines. As the closest \u2018watering hole\u2019 to the rail\nyards, the Frankton Hotel was a natural after-work venue for\nthe hundreds of men who worked in the sidings, goods sheds,\nengineering workshops and passenger services over the\ndecades. Because of its axis position and trunk line linking\nup to the Bay of Plenty and the Port of Tauranga, the\nFrankton Junction railyards were among the busiest in New\nZealand. Now the Frankton Hotel freehold land and building\nat 40 High Street are being marketed for sale by tender\nthrough Bayleys Hamilton, with the tender process closing on\nJune 25. Just the Frankton Hotel land and buildings, and not\nthe hospitality business operating inside, are being offered\nfor sale. Bayleys Hamilton salesperson Josh Smith said\nthat while the two-storey character venue on the corner of\nCommercial Street was built on servicing the needs of rail\nworkers from a bygone era, rail was also the cornerstone of\nthe venue\u2019s future. \u201cThe pub is located some 200\nmetres from Hamilton train station \u2013 which is about to\nenter a new era as it connects the city to Auckland with a\ncommuter rail service,\u201d Mr Smith said. \u201cThis new\niteration will add to the pub\u2019s existing clientele base -\nbeing the preferred licensed hospitality operation for the\nthousands of factory floor workers employed in the light\nindustrial businesses and engineering firms in the\nsurrounding Frankton area. \u201cIn addition to these patron\ndemographic target markets, the Frankton Hotel will be\nconveniently located just a short walk from the 75-unit\nRawhiti Village residential development project which is\nspearheading the gentrification of the Frankton area.\nHamilton CBD is just a 1.6 kilometre walk away. \u201cThe\npathway toward re-inventing the Frankton Hotel as a\nhospitality entity appealing to different market sectors is\nalready underway \u2013 with the Ministry for Culture and\nHeritage already signing an agreement with the current\nowners to fund $40,000 worth of refurbishment and structural\nengineering and design plans for the venue.\u201d The 1,580\nsquare metre dual level Frankton Hotel premises sit on some\n1,618 square metres of flat freehold land \u2013 and are leased\nto the venue\u2019s hospitality business tenants until 2024\nwith three further six-year rights of renewal generating\nannual rental of $104,000 plus GST and outgoings. Various\nportions of the hotel have new building standards ratings of\nbetween 25 \u2013 85 percent. Mr Smith said The Frankton\nHotel\u2019s hospitality service options encompassed two bars,\ntwo function rooms, accommodation options on the upper\nlevel, a TAB sports betting space, and an 18-machine gaming\nroom. Accommodation amenities at the hotel comprise 16 rooms\n\u2013 configured into queen/twin and triple bedrooms and two\nbackpacker dorms, with a nightly rack rate of $80 for the\nindividual rooms. \u201cThe multiple existing bar and meeting\nroom spaces within the High Street/Commercial Street\nproperty would allow any new owner of the Frankton Hotel to\nlook at upgrading the greater premises with a view to\nretaining but modernising the \u2018public\u2019 bar servicing the\nlocal working clientele, and simultaneously creating a\nseparate more upmarket bar/restaurant amenity to cater for a\nwhite-collar and family-orientated customer base,\u201d Mr\nSmith\nsaid. \u00a9 Scoop Media Bayleys Real Estate New Zealand Bayleys is New Zealand's largest full-service real estate company.

[Click here to read what\u2019s moving markets heading into Friday, June 25] Earlier, stocks traded choppily after Texas said it was pausing its reopening process due to a renewed surge in Covid-19 infections in the state. Investors also monitored incoming economic data, with a new report showing stubbornly high levels of new unemployment claims. New unemployment claims came in at 1.48 million for the week ending June 20, marking the fourteenth straight week that claims held above one million. Consensus economists had expected new claims to total 1.32 million. Since mid-March, new jobless claims totaled more than 47 million. \u201cJobless claims are not falling fast enough. Everything we have seen in the last week or two between rising case counts/hospitalizations, stalling economic progress in some important states, government job cuts, means one thing: the Phase 4 of fiscal stimulus must be bigger,\u201d Neil Dutta, head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, said in an email. \u201cThings should be better in 3-4 weeks, but the news will get worse before it gets better.\u201d The risk-off mood came after some states in the South and West reported more increases in new coronavirus cases. California reported more than 7,100 new cases \u2013 a one-day record by far for the state \u2013 while Florida and Texas also reported record jumps in new cases at more than 5,500 each as of Wednesday\u2019s counts. New York, once the nation\u2019s epicenter of new coronavirus cases, along with New Jersey and Connecticut called for a 14-day quarantine for visitors traveling from many of the states seeing major jumps in new cases. With the pandemic still ongoing, the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday slashed its outlook for 2020 global growth to a record low estimate of -4.9% , down from its April estimate of -3%. US global growth is expected to fall by 8.0% in 2020, down from a previous forecast of -5.9%, before rising by 4.5% in 2021. \u2014 4:03 p.m. ET: Stocks shake off earlier declines after Texas halts reopening, ending up for the day Here were the main moves in markets as of 4:03 p.m. ET: S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) : +33.40 (+1.09%) to 3,083.73 Dow ( ^DJI ) : +299.73 (+1.18%) to 25,745.67 Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) : +107.84 (+1.09%) to 10,017.00 Crude ( CL=F ) : +$1.02 (+2.68%) to $39.03 a barrel Gold ( GC=F ) : -$2.80 (-0.16%) to $1,772.30 per ounce 10-year Treasury ( ^TNX ) : -1 bps to yield 0.6740% \u2014 3:19 p.m. ET: Apple set to close more stores in Florida Apple ( AAPL ) said it would be closing 14 retail locations in Florida starting on Friday due to rising coronavirus infections in the state. The company now has re-closed 32 stores across the country. Earlier this week, Apple said it intended to close seven stores in the Houston, Texas area, as that state grappled with a surge in new infections and hospitalizations. The iPhone-maker also announced re-closures of 11 stores across Florida, Arizona, South Carolina and North Carolina last week. \u2014 11:47 a.m. ET: Texas announces halt of phased reopening process Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday just before noon eastern that Texas will temporarily pause any further reopening of state businesses due to the recent increase in virus infections and hospitalizations. Texas had announced the third phase of its reopening process earlier this month , which allowed most businesses including restaurants, bars and amusement parks to open and expand some capacity. \u201cAs we experience an increase in both positive COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, we are focused on strategies that slow the spread of this virus while also allowing Texans to continue earning a paycheck to support their families,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cThe last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business.\u201d \u2014 11:42 a.m. ET: Stocks fall anew Here were the main moves in markets, as of 11:42 a.m. ET: S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) : -13.86 points (-0.45%) to 3,036.47 Dow ( ^DJI ) : -110.35 points (-0.43%) to 25,335.59 Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) : -18.55 points (-0.19%) to 9,892.26 Crude ( CL=F ) : +$0.39 (+1.03%) to $38.40 a barrel Gold ( GC=F ) : -$7.70 (-0.43%) to $1,767.40 per ounce 10-year Treasury ( ^TNX ) : -1.5 bps to yield 0.669% \u2014 10:40 a.m. ET: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott suspends elective surgeries in major cities across the state amid virus spike Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order suspending elective surgeries in major cities in Texas, as a resurgence of virus cases swept the state. The order applies to elective surgeries at hospitals in Bexar, Dallas, Harris, and Travis counties. \u201cAs Texas faces a rise in COVID-19 cases, we are focused on both slowing the spread of this virus and maintaining sufficient hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. \u201cThese four counties have experienced significant increases in people being hospitalized due to COVID-19 and today\u2019s action is a precautionary step to help ensure that the hospitals in these counties continue to have ample supply of available beds to treat COVID-19 patients. Story continues \u2014 10:35 a.m. ET: Stocks turn positive, shaking off earlier losses The three major indices pushed into positive territory Thursday morning after opening lower. The Financial and Energy sectors led gains in the S&P 500, with each rallying more than 1.5%. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and American Express led gains in the Dow. \u2014 9:36 a.m. ET: Stocks open lower Here were the main moves in markets, as of 9:37 a.m. ET: S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) : -6.06 points (-0.2%) to 3,044.27 Dow ( ^DJI ) : -92.37 points (-0.36%) to 25,353.57 Nasdaq ( ^IXIC ) : -9.06 points (-0.11%) to 9,896.84 Crude ( CL=F ) : -$0.2 (-0.53%) to $37.81 a barrel Gold ( GC=F ) : -$1.90 (-0.11%) to $1,773.20 per ounce 10-year Treasury ( ^TNX ) : -2 bps to yield 0.664% \u2014 8:56 a.m. ET: New York hospitalizations drop below 1,000 for the first time since March 18 New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that the state hit a \u201cnew milestone,\u201d with hospitalizations dropping below the 1,000-mark for the first time since mid-March. The state, once the US epicenter of the outbreak, has been gradually reopening businesses over the past several weeks, with new cases, hospitalizations and deaths trending lower state-wide and in New York City after more than two months\u2019 worth of social distancing restrictions. BREAKING: Today NY reached a new milestone. Total hospitalizations fell to 996 \u2014 dropping below 1K for the first time since March 18th. Together we bent the curve.

Stay smart. #NewYorkTough \u2014 Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 25, 2020 \u2014 8:32 a.m. ET: Durable goods orders rise 15.8% in May, topping expectations Orders for durable goods, or products intended to last three years or more, rose by a greater than expected margin in May, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s preliminary monthly report. These orders rose 15.8% in May versus a 10.5% increase expected. The jump marked the biggest increase since July 2014. In April, durable goods orders fell by a downwardly revised 18.1%, which had been the biggest drop since August 2014. Core capital goods orders, which exclude aircraft and military goods and serve as a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 2.3%, or more than double consensus expectations. \u2014 8:30 a.m. ET: New jobless claims totaled 1.48 million last week, vs. 1.32 million expected New weekly unemployment insurance claims totaled 1.48 million for the week ended June 20, the Labor Department said Thursday. This was above estimates for 1.32 million, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The previous week\u2019s new unemployment insurance claims were revised up slightly to 1.54 million, from the 1.508 million previously reported. Continuing unemployment insurance claims fell more than expected for the week ended June 13. These declined to 19.522 million, from the previous week\u2019s 20.289 million. \u2014 7:23 a.m. ET: Stock futures mostly lower ahead of the opening bell Here were the main moves in markets, as of 7:23 a.m. ET: S&P 500 futures ( ES=F ) : 3,039.75, down 9.25 points or 0.3% Dow futures ( YM=F ) : 25,285.00, down 108 points, or 0.43% Nasdaq futures ( NQ=F ): 10,014.75, up 4 points, or 0.04% Crude ( CL=F ) : -$0.44 (-1.16%) to $37.57 a barrel Gold ( GC=F ) : -$2.90 (-0.16%) to $1,772.20 per ounce 10-year Treasury ( ^TNX ) : -1.8 bps to yield 0.666% \u2014 6:05 p.m. ET: Stock futures slightly higher after selloff Here were the main moves at the start of the overnight session for U.S. equity futures, as of 6:05 p.m. ET: S&P 500 futures ( ES=F ) : 3,051.5, up 2.5 points or 0.07% Dow futures ( YM=F ) : 25,421.00, up 28 points, or 0.11% Nasdaq futures ( NQ=F ): 10,020.75, up 10 points, or 0.1% NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 20: Traders, some in medical masks, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on March 20, 2020 in New York City.

Silver, despite record retail investment, has sunk to its lowest price in 11 years due to lower industrial demand. In this part, we use S&P Global Market Intelligence data and insight to look at how the metal price environment for the precious metals and uranium has evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the gold price dropped mid-March along with those for most other commodities and markets, it has since come back strongly on the back of higher financial investment demand. Meanwhile, silver, despite record retail investment, has sunk to its lowest price in 11 years due to lower industrial demand. Looking at the platinum group metals, or PGM, lockdowns in South Africa and plummeting global auto sales have severely shocked prices. This disruption has kept an uneasy balance, however, and has not yet fundamentally changed the price trajectories of upward for palladium and rhodium, and downward for platinum. Gold: After the fall, time to shine Despite being the archetypal safe-haven asset, gold, like everything else, eventually took a hit to the downside on the realization that COVID-19 would become a global pandemic. Through mid-February, gold continued in its slow-burn bull market, driven by two main factors. The first was safe-haven buying resulting from global uncertainty, tied to the shutdown in China up to that point, and also the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and eurozone weakness. The second was low to negative yields on high-quality government bonds. When funds have to pay for lending to governments, the attractiveness of gold increases, especially when the cost to hold is at a historical low. While gold performed well in the lead-up to the stock market crash \u2014 reaching a seven-year high of US$1,684 per ounce March 6 \u2014 when it became clear March 12 that the U.S. economy would take a serious hit, gold began to fall at the same time as equities. Gold performed in a fashion similar to the 2008 financial crisis, in that funds with positions in gold in the futures markets were forced to sell their gold to meet margin calls, raise cash and buy U.S. treasuries. We look in more depth at this phenomenon in an earlier\u00a0article . This selling on the futures market overwhelmed significant positive sentiment on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, major retail buying in the West and large inflows into gold exchange-traded funds, or ETF. From the week beginning March 23, however, the gold price rebounded at the same time as a bear market rally in U.S. stocks. Since then, gold is back up above the highs before the stock market crash, with the Comex price reaching US$1,752.6/oz on April 7 on an intraday basis. Looking at managed money positions, the net long on gold has been fairly flat since August 2019, changing little until the mid-March stock market crash. The net longs dropping to their lowest level since July 2019 was more related to a drop in the volume traded. In fact, the gross short position of 1.56 million ounces in the week starting March 29 was the lowest in over 10 years. So, clearly, the positive market sentiment for gold remains. Meanwhile, gold continues to flow into ETFs, with 132.5 tonnes moving in between Feb. 28 and March 27, according to the\u00a0World Gold Council. On March 27, total holdings stood at 3,165.5 tonnes, the highest amount ever. On the retail side, sellers are\u00a0reporting\u00a0huge demand for bars and coins, with many lines out of stock or with long wait times. This shortfall has been exacerbated by the temporary closure of the main gold refineries\u00a0Valcambi SA,\u00a0Argor-Heraeus SA\u00a0and\u00a0PAMP SA\u00a0in Switzerland, due to the lockdown in that country. They have\u00a0signaled\u00a0in recent days, however, that they will partially re-open, helping miners to bring their gold to the market and investors to buy it. Despite the mid-March fall in the gold price, in tandem with the stock market crash, the yellow metal has recovered and the market appears convinced that it is on an upward trajectory. There are some negative signals for the market, however, namely reduced jewelry buying in India and China due to pandemic lockdowns. In addition, we\u00a0forecast\u00a0a mine production shortfall stemming from shutdowns in major mining countries. Silver: Double hit with not much light at the end of the tunnel The silver price, which has largely traded sideways since 2015, has plummeted to multiyear lows. Starting March 12, when U.S. stock markets had their greatest single-day fall since the 1987 crash, silver fell from US$17.02/oz to US$12.01/oz on March 19, a fall of 29%. That is the lowest price for silver since April 17, 2009. Although the price has recovered slightly in recent weeks, at around US$14/oz it remains near the lows of 2019 and has wiped out the brief rally enjoyed in the second half of 2019 and the first two months of 2020. Being both a financial and an industrial metal, silver has been dealt a double blow. With manufacturing purchasing manager indexes down across the board, silver industrial demand, which largely comes from brazing alloys and electronic and photovoltaic fabrication, is forecast to decline. On the financial side, traders have been closing out their positions on the futures markets to meet margin calls and to raise cash to buy government bonds \u2014 much like the situation with gold. Having said that, demand for physical silver in the Western world had skyrocketed when stock markets crashed and silver prices went down, with bullion and coin merchants reporting unprecedented demand. Indeed, at the time of writing, none of the main U.K. online dealers had any silver bars in stock. This has been matched in the ETF markets, with reports of huge inflows. While silver was dragged down during the stock market crash, the weakness of industrial demand has acted as a lead weight for silver, leaving it unable to ride gold's coattails upward on the back of safe-haven buying. According to\u00a0The Silver Institute, in 2018 the ratio of industrial demand over investment demand was 2.5. In the short term, the outlook for the precious metal is bleak given the weak economic conditions. If this crisis continues into the third quarter, however, we expect that reductions in mine supply due to a national shutdown in Peru, the second-largest producer of silver, will have an impact on the net balance. PGM: Finding a volatile equilibrium Even before the COVID-19 crisis spread across the global economy in March, the PGM markets were experiencing a volatile period. The ultimate repercussions of the \"dieselgate\" emissions cheating scandal were being felt, in that car manufacturers were being forced to comply with emissions standards across a broad range of conditions, not just a single lab test. Those emissions are controlled by catalytic converters, which use PGM to reduce emissions of unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. In order to meet these standards, higher loadings of PGM are needed, so that despite a\u00a0global car sales recession\u00a0in 2019, demand for PGM has risen. The different uses of platinum and palladium in autocatalysts had led to their large price divergence in recent years. Palladium is used more in gasoline vehicles, while platinum has a higher weighting in diesel vehicles. In the short-to-medium term, consumers are moving back to gasoline vehicles in markets like Europe, driving up demand and, with limited supply, the price. Palladium reached an all-time high of US$2,781/oz on February 27, continuing a string of all-time highs since January 2018. The fresh highs were caused by\u00a0Anglo American Platinum Ltd.'s, or Amplats, announcement that it was declaring force majeure at its Waterval smelter due to a\u00a0dust explosion. This caused analysts to forecast an even wider palladium market deficit in 2020. The market moved sideways for the next week, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped as a result of the Russia-Saudi Arabia oil price war. The March 12 stock market crash caused the London Bullion Market Association price to drop by US$339/oz in a single day, the largest single-day decline ever, due to global recession fears. For the next week, prices found a floor at US$1,600/oz, before rebounding in a classic U-shaped recovery. Platinum fell from US$879/oz on March 11 to US$593/oz on March 19, the lowest price since December 2002, a 17-year low. Since then, the price has managed to stay above US$700/oz, which is less of a recovery than palladium has enjoyed. Market participants are concerned that sales of diesel vehicles will be hit harder than sales of gasoline vehicles, since the former are more popular in Europe, where the current restrictions show no sign of being lifted. Indeed, car sales figures were\u00a0down year over year\u00a0in March, by 85% in Italy, 72% in France, 69% in Spain and 44% in the U.K. On the supply side, following the stock market crash South Africa, the world's top miner of all PGM, declared a 21-day lockdown due to COVID-19, which led to Amplats,\u00a0Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd.\u00a0and\u00a0Sibanye-Stillwater Ltd.\u00a0all\u00a0declaring force majeure\u00a0March 30, which will further constrict supply. However, this comes as just at the time when vehicle demand is down the most in decades, and therefore demand for PGM is down. It appears, therefore, that the market is trying to find a new equilibrium, with slightly lower prices. Much like palladium, rhodium had been increasing in price at an exceptional rate since the start of the year. This was driven by tightness in the thinly traded market, caused by restricted supply and increased demand as a result of more stringent enforcement of vehicle emissions standards. Just days before the Schengen travel ban was put in place by the U.S. government, rhodium reached an all-time high of US$13,800/oz, up a staggering 128% since the start of the year. Since then, in a pattern similar to many others, the price quickly dropped, falling by 60% in eight business days to US$5,500/oz on March 24. With mine supply drying up, the only certainty is that market volatility will remain. U3O8: The best performer since the crash The uranium price is normally less susceptible to global headwinds than other commodities, since most output is taken up by three-to-five-year agreements with fixed prices. The uranium price, therefore, had a muted reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak compared with other commodities, falling only 3.8% from the start of the year to March 22. However,\u00a0Cameco Corp.\u00a0announced\u00a0March 23 that it was placing the\u00a0Cigar Lake\u00a0mine in Canada, the world's largest uranium mine, producing 13% of global supply in 2019, on care and maintenance. This was done to protect workers from COVID-19, which was difficult without closure due to the operation's remote location in northern Saskatchewan, where miners fly in to work. The closure caused a\u00a0rally\u00a0in the price, to above US$27 per pound for the first time in one year, as market participants worried about possible supply shortages. On April 7,\u00a0JSC National Atomic Co. Kazatomprom\u00a0announced\u00a0that was reducing its 2020 guidance by 4,000 tonnes of elemental uranium, which makes up 18% of its previous guidance. The Kazakh company, the world's largest uranium producer, previously stated in a March\u00a0press release\u00a0that COVID-19 could cause significant disruption to its remote mining sites in southern Kazakhstan, due to the close quarters in which its employees work. The press release caused the price to leap still further to US$29/tonne on April 8. While global demand for power has declined due to widespread industrial shutdowns, baseload electricity demand remains. Production of uranium is highly concentrated among a small number of companies and countries; if mines continue to close temporarily, we expect upward pressure on prices to remain.

The restrictions, which would extend to a ban on dividend payments and share buybacks, could be imposed on companies where the government has taken an equity stake in order to keep the business afloat through the global pandemic. If backed by the EU\u2019s 27-member states, the rules would apply to the UK \u2013 under the Brexit transition period, which is due to end on 31 December, the UK follows all EU rules but is not able to help decide them.

The paper has been drawn up by the EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager , as the EU executive rapidly amends state-aid rules to prevent them smothering crisis-rescue plans. The commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, has already relaxed the rules to help governments provide financial lifelines to companies, which in normal economic times would be seen as anti-competitive. The latest paper assesses further measures that may be needed, after economists at the International Monetary Fund warned the world was on the brink of the worst economic downturn since the 1930s. The document examines how governments might support ailing companies by taking equity stakes as part of rescue schemes, described as \u201can intervention of the last resort\u201d. Insiders are uncertain when the document will be published, and expect it to be changed after discussions between Vestager and her fellow commissioners, followed by EU member states. British firms to be given more protection from bankruptcy Read more Companies benefiting from a coronavirus-related equity stake would be barred from \u201caggressive commercial expansion financed by state aid\u201d. Neither will they be able to buy competitors or other operators in their line of business until the state has been repaid. Some limited acquisitions may be allowed, but only to maintain a company\u2019s viability. Until the state has been repaid, executives will be limited to their base salaries, with no special awards. \u201cUnder no circumstances, bonuses, other variable or comparable remuneration elements shall be paid,\u201d the document states. Large companies benefiting from a government stake of more than 20% would be obliged to set out \u201cexit strategies\u201d within six months of getting help. These plans would detail how a company intended to repay the state. In a sign that internal negotiations are not finished, the 20% and six-month variables are still in negotiators\u2019 square brackets, evidence that the EU executive has yet to take a final position.

Unit A, 49 William\nPickering Drive, Albany is one of four industrial\nunit-titled properties on a large site located near the\njunction with Rosedale Road, and zoned Business-Light\nIndustry. It has been home to New Brew Bar for nearly 20\nyears and there is a 9-year lease from September 2014 with\nannual reviews and a 6-year right of renewal in place,\nreturning a net rental of $130,571 plus GST. The current\nowner of the building is transitioning his property\nportfolio to the Bay of Plenty and also looking to relocate\nto the region, so is selling his Auckland-based\nassets. Bayleys agents Eddie Zhong and Millie Liang are\nmarketing the property which is to be sold by auction on\n24th June at Bayleys Auckland Central. Zhong says the\nproperty was built in 2001 and developed into a bar and\nrestaurant with a good quality fitout. New Brew Bar has\noperated from this site since 2002, with its current\nbusiness owners, Julian and Veronica Dapena, taking over in\n2012. Subsequent improvements have been made to the\nproperty, with the main feature being a covered front\ncourtyard area which extends the venue\u2019s footprint with\noutdoor seating areas. \u201cThis is a well-performing\nhospitality operation that has cemented its place in the\nlocal community and has generated good returns,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cNew Brew Bar has grown a loyal customer base and\nworked hard to establish a strong reputation for good food\nand all-round hospitality, and its owners are looking\nforward to continuing this for many years to\ncome. \u201cThroughout the COVID-19 lockdown and subsequent\nalert levels, the business remained in contact with its\nregular customers through social media channels and offered\nonline ordering and collection for meals, along with live\nmusic performances via Facebook. \u201cThe business has shown\nresilience and adaptability and it\u2019s seeing a steady\nreturn of its local clientele as alert level restrictions\nease.\u201d Liang says retail/industrial units in the wider\nAlbany area have proven popular with investors for some\nyears now, and even during lockdown, deals were being\ncompleted. \u201cThere\u2019s a well-documented shortage of\nquality stock on the market and while it is too early to say\nwhat impact the latest global health crisis will have on\ncommercial property prices, we expect solid demand for\nwell-located, well-tenanted properties,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cThe owner\u2019s decision to take the property to\nauction shows a clear commitment to letting the market speak\nand establish value.\u201d The property has 368sqm of floor\narea, a 56sqm courtyard with consented canopy and 24\ndedicated on-site car parks \u2013 a particularly rare asset\nfor such a property. Internally, the space is largely\ntaken up by bar and restaurant seating, and there\u2019s a\ngenerous commercial kitchen, office spaces and storage to\nthe rear along with male and female bathroom amenities and\nstaff facilities. There are polished aggregate floors in\nthe main public areas and large bi-fold doors lead out to\nthe front courtyard area which is partially-enclosed with\nschist walls and features retractable all-weather\nblinds. Zhong says the business operation benefits from a\nlarge commercial and residential catchment area which is\nwell-resourced. \u201cThe residential homes in the broader\narea are generally of high value and supported by quality\nschooling options,\u201d he says. \u201cThese households have\nstrong purchasing power and the North Shore offers them an\nextensive array of services, including a diverse selection\nof hospitality venues. \u201cIt will take more than a global\npandemic for Kiwis to completely change their social ways\nand stop meeting at their favourite local entertainment and\nhospitality spots once it is deemed safe to do so without\nrestriction. \u201cNew Brew Bar has found customers returning\nwith confidence proving that having a beer with mates,\nenjoying a quiz night or a live music gig, and eating out\nwith family and friends is a big part of the New Zealand way\nof\nlife.\u201d \u00a9 Scoop Media Bayleys Real Estate New Zealand Bayleys is New Zealand's largest full-service real estate company.

Amid suggestions that pubs could be closed until Christmas, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said \u201cextra support\u201d would be required for an industry already in long-term decline . In an appeal to the government, the BBPA said the furlough scheme to help businesses pay staff would need to be made available to pub owners for longer. Business rates relief could also be extended to 10,000 pubs that were currently ineligible, the BBPA said. Pubs with annual rental values higher than \u00a351,000 are not included in a retail and hospitality scheme that offers grants of up to \u00a325,000 to help during the nationwide shutdown. The BBPA chief executive, Emma McClarkin, said: \u201cWhen this crisis is over we will all want to go to the pub, so it\u2019s vital the government does everything it can to help them right now.\u201d McClarkin said the industry would need extra support if the easing of lockdown restrictions was still far off. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said on Sunday that pubs and restaurants would be \u201camong the last to exit the lockdown\u201d. \u201cIf pubs are going to be the last to reopen, then it\u2019s only right the government gives extra support to them to help ensure their survival,\u201d said McClarkin. \u201cWe are clear that unless the government gives specific support to pubs now, thousands of them in communities across the UK could be lost for good. And with them hundreds of thousands of jobs too.\u201d The BBPA\u2019s appeal comes with some of its large pub company members under pressure for failing to cancel rents charged to publicans, even though they have no source of revenue. Edward Anderson, who runs three pubs in Cheltenham, said: \u201cI\u2019m paying \u00a314,000-a-month rent. If we\u2019re going to be closed until Christmas, it\u2019s just debt that we can\u2019t repay when we reopen. Our immediate priority is some sensible discussion about pubcos indebting their tenants.\u201d A spokesperson for the BBPA said: \u201cRent is a commercial decision and the BBPA does not advise its members on commercial decisions.\u201d Pubs, bars and restaurants have been among the businesses hit hardest by the Covid-19 outbreak, with customer numbers plummeting even before the lockdown as the government advised people to stay away. The number of pubs has already been in long-term decline amid changing consumer trends such as a move towards buying cheap supermarket alcohol to drink at home and a growing penchant for sobriety among younger people. But figures released in December offered a glimmer of hope for the industry, with the first net increase in pub numbers since 2010. The UK ended March 2019 with 39,135 pubs, 320 more than a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Simply Wall St July 28, 2020 Broadly speaking, profitable businesses are less risky than unprofitable ones. However, sometimes companies receive a one-off boost (or reduction) to their profit, and it\u2019s not always clear whether statutory profits are a good guide, going forward. Today we\u2019ll focus on whether this year\u2019s statutory profits are a good guide to understanding City Pub Group (LON:CPC). While City Pub Group was able to generate revenue of UK\u00a360.0m in the last twelve months, we think its profit result of UK\u00a31.31m was more important. View our latest analysis for City Pub Group AIM:CPC Earnings and Revenue History July 28th 2020 Importantly, statutory profits are not always the best tool for understanding a company\u2019s true earnings power, so it\u2019s well worth examining profits in a little more detail. In this article we\u2019ll look at how City Pub Group is impacting shareholders by issuing new shares, as well as how unusual items have affected the income line. That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can click here to see an interactive graph depicting future profitability, based on their estimates. One essential aspect of assessing earnings quality is to look at how much a company is diluting shareholders. In fact, City Pub Group increased the number of shares on issue by 74% over the last twelve months by issuing new shares. That means its earnings are split among a greater number of shares. Per share metrics like EPS help us understand how much actual shareholders are benefitting from the company\u2019s profits, while the net income level gives us a better view of the company\u2019s absolute size. Check out City Pub Group\u2019s historical EPS growth by clicking on this link . A Look At The Impact Of City Pub Group\u2019s Dilution on Its Earnings Per Share (EPS). Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have any visibility into its profits three years back, because we lack the data. And even focusing only on the last twelve months, we see profit is down 33%. Sadly, earnings per share fell further, down a full 36% in that time. So you can see that the dilution has had a fairly significant impact on shareholders. If City Pub Group\u2019s EPS can grow over time then that drastically improves the chances of the share price moving in the same direction. However, if its profit increases while its earnings per share stay flat (or even fall) then shareholders might not see much benefit. For that reason, you could say that EPS is more important that net income in the long run, assuming the goal is to assess whether a company\u2019s share price might grow. The Impact Of Unusual Items On Profit On top of the dilution, we should also consider the UK\u00a32.9m impact of unusual items in the last year, which had the effect of suppressing profit. While deductions due to unusual items are disappointing in the first instance, there is a silver lining. When we analysed the vast majority of listed companies worldwide, we found that significant unusual items are often not repeated. And that\u2019s hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. In the twelve months to December 2019, City Pub Group had a big unusual items expense. All else being equal, this would likely have the effect of making the statutory profit look worse than its underlying earnings power. Our Take On City Pub Group\u2019s Profit Performance City Pub Group suffered from unusual items which depressed its profit in its last report; if that is not repeated then profit should be higher, all else being equal. But unfortunately the dilution means that shareholders now own a smaller proportion of the company (assuming they maintained the same number of shares). That will weigh on earnings per share, even if it is not reflected in net income. Based on these factors, it\u2019s hard to tell if City Pub Group\u2019s profits are a reasonable reflection of its underlying profitability. In light of this, if you\u2019d like to do more analysis on the company, it\u2019s vital to be informed of the risks involved. Our analysis shows 6 warning signs for City Pub Group (2 shouldn\u2019t be ignored!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing. In this article we\u2019ve looked at a number of factors that can impair the utility of profit numbers, as a guide to a business. But there are plenty of other ways to inform your opinion of a company.

TROISE Associated Press 29 May 2020 Reblog Share Tweet Share Share Stocks closed out a solid week on Wall Street Friday with a late-afternoon rebound after worries that President Donald Trump would reignite a costly trade war with China faded. The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.5%, recovering from a 1% slide, after Trump outlined several actions in response to a move by China to exert more control over Hong Kong but steered clear of upending a trade pact struck with Beijing earlier this year. The S&P 500 ended the month 4.5% higher, its second monthly gain in a row. The world\u2019s two largest economies agreed to a Phase 1 trade deal in January after more than a year of talks and billions of dollars in tariffs imposed on each other\u2019s imports. Worries that the Trump administration would pull out of the deal with the world\u2019s second-largest economy weighed on the market for much of the day, until the president\u2019s mid-afternoon statement. \u201cMuch ado about nothing,\u201d Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said of the remarks. \u201cThe immediate concern, meaning the cessation of the Phase 1 (trade) accord, did not end up being put on the table, much to traders\u2019 relief.\u201d Technology and health care stocks accounted for much of the market\u2019s gains. That helped offset losses in banks, industrial companies and elsewhere. Bond yields fell and gold prices rose, signs that investors remain cautious. Oil recovered from an early slide. All told, the S&P 500 rose 14.58 points to 3,044.31. The index ended the week with a 3% gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 17.53 points, or 0.1%, to 25,383.11. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, gained 120.88 points, or 1.3%, to 9,489.87. The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks gave up 6.64 points, or 0.5%, to 1,394.04. Stocks have now recouped most of their losses after the initial economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic knocked the market into a breathtaking skid in February and March, though the S&P 500 is still down 10% from its all-time high in February. On Thursday, China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress approved a national security law aimed at suppressing secessionist and subversive activity in Hong Kong, overriding any potential opposition by local lawmakers. In his remarks, Trump blasted China, saying Hong Kong is no longer \u201csufficiently autonomous\u201d to warrant the preferred status that the U.S. had been giving the former British colony when it comes to export controls, extradition treaties and travel. \u201cBasically, he\u2019s going to treat Hong Kong the way he treats China,\" Stovall said. Trump also said the U.S. would cut ties with the World Health Organization, saying it had failed to adequately respond to the coronavirus because China has \u201ctotal control\u201d over the global organization. The move by China to get a tighter grip on Hong Kong could undermine the city\u2019s status as a major center for trade and finance. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index finished 0.7% lower Friday. Washington and Beijing have been trading harsh rhetoric recently on everything from Hong Kong to the response to the coronavirus outbreak. That stoked worries that the renewed tensions could lead to another punishing round of escalating tariffs between the two countries, which would only further damage a global economy punished by a severe recession due to the pandemic. The U.S. stock market plunged 34% from late February through late March but has rebounded quickly since then after the Federal Reserve and Congress pledged unprecedented amounts of aid for the economy. Recently, investors have favored stocks that would benefit the most from a reopening economy. Governments around the country and around the world are slowly lifting restrictions meant to corral the outbreak. That has many investors hoping the worst of the recession has already passed, or will soon. However, concerns remain that the relaxing of stay-at-home mandates and the reopening of businesses could lead to another surge in infections, potentially extending how long it will take for the economy to recover. \u201cWe\u2019re in an incredibly fragile economy right now, and things are just getting back,\u201d said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \u201cYou need as much momentum as you can that encourages people to go out and spend money. Anything that upsets that fragile sort of enterprise has the opportunity to really set the stock market and the total economy off course.\u201d Story continues The yield on the 10-year Treasury, a benchmark for interest rates on many consumer loans including mortgages, fell to 0.65% from 0.70% late Thursday. Lower yields mean investors are cautious about the prospects for economic growth and healthy amounts of inflation. Oil prices rose. Benchmark U.S. crude oil for July delivery rose $1.78 to settle at $35.49 a barrel. Brent crude oil for July delivery rose 4 cents to $35.33 a barrel. Stock indexes in Europe closed broadly lower following a mixed finish in Asian markets. Reblog Share Tweet Share Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Simply Wall St May 1, 2020 A look at the shareholders of The City Pub Group plc ( LON:CPC ) can tell us which group is most powerful. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it\u2019s not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Companies that used to be publicly owned tend to have lower insider ownership. With a market capitalization of UK\u00a383m, City Pub Group is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it\u2019s seems that institutional investors have bought into the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about City Pub Group. View our latest analysis for City Pub Group AIM:CPC Ownership Summary May 1st 2020 What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About City Pub Group? Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. City Pub Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 55% of the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can\u2019t rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of City Pub Group, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. AIM:CPC Income Statement May 1st 2020 Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Our data indicates that hedge funds own 11% of City Pub Group. That\u2019s interesting, because hedge funds can be quite active and activist. Many look for medium term catalysts that will drive the share price higher. The company\u2019s largest shareholder is Otus Capital Management Limited, with ownership of 11%, Hargreave Hale Limited, Asset Management Arm is the second largest shareholder with 8.1% of common stock, followed by BlackRock, Inc., holding 8.0% of the stock. We also observed that the top 8 shareholders account for 51% of the register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There is some analyst coverage of the stock, but it could still become more well known, with time. Insider Ownership Of City Pub Group While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in The City Pub Group plc. As individuals, the insiders collectively own UK\u00a34.0m worth of the UK\u00a383m company. It is good to see some investment by insiders, but I usually like to see higher insider holdings. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public Ownership The general public holds a 23% stake in CPC. While this group can\u2019t necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Private Equity Ownership Private equity firms hold a 5.2% stake in CPC. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public. Next Steps: While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

Today\u2019s clearance expands the existing FDA-cleared uses of clonoSEQ, as the FDA previously granted the assay De Novo designation for the detection and monitoring of MRD in bone marrow from multiple myeloma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. \u00a0Access to clonoSEQ for CLL patients nationwide is supported by the already-established Medicare coverage of clonoSEQ in CLL, as well as by the FDA\u2019s clearance of clonoSEQ testing for CLL patients in blood and marrow. Medicare coverage is critically important in CLL, as nearly 80 percent of patients living with CLL in the U.S. are of Medicare age. clonoSEQ\u2019s ability to detect MRD in blood provides CLL patients and health care providers with a more convenient and less intrusive option to monitor disease burden.\u201cFDA clearance of clonoSEQ, which can detect one single cancer cell among a million healthy cells, is an important milestone for the CLL community,\u201d said Dr. Brian Koffman, Chief Medical Officer and EVP of the CLL Society, Inc. \u201cLooking with greater accuracy for persistent cancer cells can show how well treatment is working and may help inform important decisions such as changing or stopping therapy. In my own CLL journey, knowing my clonoSEQ MRD status has impacted the way my expert team of doctors and I manage my disease.\u201dFDA clearance of clonoSEQ in CLL was based on clinical validation data from two important clinical trials:  * In an analysis of data from the CLL14 study (n=337), patients with undetectable MRD in blood by clonoSEQ at three months post-treatment had a nearly seven-fold reduced risk of disease progression compared with patients who did not reach undetectable MRD. For purposes of this analysis, an undetectable MRD was defined at a level of 1 cancer cell among one hundred thousand healthy cells (10-5).  * Additional evaluation of the data showed that at 30 months post-treatment, the probability of disease progression for evaluable patients with undetectable MRD was only 5%, as compared to 36% for patients with detectable disease.  * In a second study by Thompson et al, clonoSEQ MRD results were shown to be significantly predictive of outcomes in both blood and bone marrow samples, regardless of the threshold at which MRD was assessed.\u00a0MRD refers to the remaining number of cancer cells that are present in a patient\u2019s body during and after treatment, which may eventually lead to recurrence of the disease. MRD assessment is performed as a series of tests throughout a patient\u2019s cancer journey to evaluate prognosis, determine response to treatment, monitor disease during remission and predict potential relapse. Controlled trials in CLL as well as other blood cancers have shown that even the smallest amounts of residual disease can predict a patient\u2019s long-term clinical outcomes. As novel therapies make deeper and more durable responses achievable for many blood cancer patients, clinicians are increasingly utilizing MRD results to help guide day-to-day patient management. \u00a0\u201cWe know that traditional CLL treatment response criteria are insufficient, so the ability to measure MRD with a test that is one hundred times more sensitive than standard flow cytometry may change our approach to treating CLL,\u201d said Dr. John Pagel, principal investigator and Chief of Hematologic Malignancies at the Swedish Cancer Institute. \u201cA patient\u2019s MRD status gives us timely information about how a treatment is working, so patients and providers can be in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to managing their disease and treatment decisions.\u201dThe availability of clonoSEQ testing in blood will facilitate ease of testing for CLL patients, but as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, some patients may be unable to or may feel anxious about obtaining a blood draw in a hospital or clinic.\u00a0 To address this, Adaptive has launched a service offering which will enable clonoSEQ patients to safely obtain blood draws in alternate settings. Patients can either access minimal-contact blood collection services at any of the nearly 2,000 LabCorp Patient Service Centers in the U.S., or they can have a blood draw performed by a qualified professional in the comfort of their own homes through Adaptive\u2019s collaboration with Phlebotek Solutions, a nationwide provider of mobile phlebotomy services.\u201cThe FDA clearance of clonoSEQ in CLL represents a significant advancement for patients with CLL,\u201d said Lance Baldo, Chief Medical Officer of Adaptive Biotechnologies. \u201cWe believe this first-time clearance for clonoSEQ in blood will be advantageous for both providers and patients. Given the risks that COVID-19 poses for cancer patients, we are proud to be collaborating with two best-in-class service providers to offer clonoSEQ patients flexible and safe options for blood sample collection outside of a hospital or clinic.\u201dAbout the clonoSEQ\u00a0Assay  Prior to CLL, the clonoSEQ Assay was granted De Novo designation and marketing authorization by the FDA for the detection and monitoring of MRD in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using DNA from bone marrow samples. clonoSEQ is the first clinical diagnostic powered by immunosequencing to receive FDA clearance. clonoSEQ leverages Adaptive\u2019s proprietary immune medicine platform to identify and quantify specific DNA sequences found in malignant cells, allowing clinicians to assess and monitor MRD during and after treatment. The assay provides standardized, accurate and sensitive measurement of MRD that allows physicians to predict patient outcomes, assess response to therapy over time, monitor patients during remission and predict potential relapse. Clinical practice guidelines in hematological malignancies recognize that MRD status is a reliable indicator of clinical outcomes and response to therapy, and clinical outcomes have been shown to be strongly associated with MRD levels measured by the clonoSEQ Assay in patients diagnosed with CLL, MM and ALL.\u00a0clonoSEQ is a single-site assay performed at Adaptive Biotechnologies.\u00a0It is also available as a CLIA-validated laboratory developed test (LDT) service for use in other lymphoid cancers.\u00a0 For important information about the FDA-cleared uses of clonoSEQ, including the full intended use, limitations, and detailed performance characteristics, please visit\u00a0www.clonoSEQ.com/technical-summary.About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)  CLL is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).\u00a0 It is one of the most common types of\u00a0leukemia\u00a0in adults. The disease often occurs during or after middle age, with the average age of diagnosis at 70 years old. There were more than 20,000 new cases of CLL in the U.S. in 2019 and more than 200,000 people in the U.S. are currently living with CLL. CLL is considered incurable but 5-year and 10-year survival rates are high, such that many people will require additional treatment over time due to the return of cancerous cells.About Adaptive Biotechnologies  Adaptive Biotechnologies\u00a0is a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on harnessing the inherent biology of the adaptive immune system to transform the diagnosis and treatment of disease. We believe the adaptive immune system is nature\u2019s most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Our proprietary immune medicine platform reveals and translates the massive genetics of the adaptive immune system with scale, precision and speed to develop products in life sciences research, clinical diagnostics, and drug discovery. We have two commercial products, and a robust clinical pipeline to diagnose, monitor and enable the treatment of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune conditions and infectious diseases. Our goal is to develop and commercialize immune-driven clinical products tailored to each individual patient.

This product leverages data by Snyder et al., made available today that map T cells from over 1,000 patients to specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens that elicit an immune response. These data also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are persisting in recovered patients for over 90 days, adding important information to the ongoing effort to define immunity to COVID-19. These results are powered by ImmuneCODE, a groundbreaking open database developed with partner Microsoft, to share the population-wide T-cell immune response to the COVID-19 virus with the research community. An abstract detailing the methodology behind ImmuneCODE, including the most recent database release, is available and the manuscript is currently undergoing peer review for future publication.\u201cThe critical role of the T-cell response is increasingly becoming a focus of attention. While antibodies have been a mainstay of measuring the immune response to vaccines, for COVID-19, it is becoming clear that the T-cell response is necessary for a complete picture of immunity,\u201d said Harlan Robins, Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder. \u201cAdaptive\u2019s proven immune medicine platform is designed for the quantitative sequencing and mapping of T cells at scale from a simple blood draw and can be incorporated seamlessly into clinical trials.\u201dimmunoSEQ T-MAP COVID provides researchers with a quantitative map of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and SARS-CoV-2 antigens that are driving the immune response to vaccines and other therapies in development for COVID-19. This reproducible, high-throughput, high resolution, molecular data will be made available through Adaptive\u2019s existing cloud-based immunoSEQ Analyzer to assist with analysis and visualization of the immune response.\u201cThe ImmuneCODE data and analyses to date have several real-world applications to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including the support of vaccine trials and therapeutic development,\u201d said Peter Lee, Corporate Vice President, Research & Incubations, Microsoft. \u201cAs we continue to grow this groundbreaking database and measure the persistence of the adaptive immune response over time, these critical findings will advance ongoing and new efforts to help solve this global public health crisis.\u201dData from the Snyder et al. manuscript elucidate the magnitude and dynamics of the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection from over 1,000 patients and several thousand controls. First, Adaptive\u2019s immune medicine platform was used to identify the parts of the virus that induce a T-cell response. These data confirm findings from other studies showing that T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is directed against a small number of viral antigens in addition to the spike protein, the current target of most vaccines in development. These targets may inform design or enhancement of next-generation vaccines.Then, the shared \u201cpublic\u201d T-cell receptors that are specific to those immunogenic parts of the virus were identified. These TCRs enable T-cell response to the virus to be measured and tracked over time at the individual and population levels. Most notably, >90% of patients still have these shared SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells for several months post confirmed diagnosis, the maximum time period currently available to assess response. Previously published research on other coronavirus infections have demonstrated persistent T cells for years following initial infection, even when antibodies are undetectable in convalescent patients, highlighting the importance of the T-cell response in understanding immunity to the virus.Based on these results and ongoing research on real-world samples, Adaptive is also completing validation of a clinical T-cell based diagnostic to broadly identify past exposure reliably and reproducibly. The Company is pursuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA for use of this diagnostic test, immunoSEQ Dx\u00ae SARS-CoV-2. \u00a0Snyder et al. can be found at: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.31.20165647v1About the T cell  T cells are the adaptive immune system\u2019s first responders to detect any virus. They quickly multiply and circulate in the blood to attack the virus, often before symptoms appear. Among many other jobs, T cells also recruit B cells to produce antibodies after about a week or two to potentially provide immunity against future infection. T cells contain a treasure trove of information that could provide one consistent and trackable measure of the immune response to COVID-19 from initial exposure through viral clearance.\u00a0T cells can \u201cremember\u201d past infections and kill pathogens if they reappear. Since the decline of antibody signals for SARS-CoV-2 over time has been reported by many researchers, T cells need to be studied to assess how long patients remain resistant to reinfection. Given T cells circulate freely in the blood, they are an easy and thus a desirable target for assessing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and potentially immunity.About ImmuneCODE  ImmuneCODE is an open database that provides a detailed population-level view into the adaptive immune response to the COVID-19 virus. Adaptive Biotechnologies and Microsoft are making these data freely available to any researcher, public health official or organization around the world to accelerate solutions to the global pandemic. The database contains detailed information on the virus-specific T cells as well as the virus-related antigens they recognize. The T-cell responses to these antigens will be tracked across the population to create an immune response signature using thousands of de-identified samples combined from organizations around the globe and ImmuneRACE, the virtual clinical study launched in May to help in the race to find a solution to COVID-19.De-identified blood samples from ImmuneRACE, including patients who were actively infected, recovered or were recently exposed to the virus, are being collected by LabCorp, through its Covance drug development business, using a mobile phlebotomy service. Immune cell receptors from these samples are being sequenced using Illumina platform technology and mapped to virus-specific antigens that are confirmed by Adaptive\u2019s proprietary immune medicine platform to induce an immune response. These study data are being pooled with data from thousands of additional unique de-identified patient samples from many institutions around the world. Using Microsoft Azure\u2019s hyperscale cloud and machine learning capabilities, the accuracy of the immune response will be continuously improved and updated online in real time as more samples are sequenced.* Providence, a large health system with 51 hospitals, including the one near Seattle that treated the first U.S. COVID-19 patient, is an initial clinical collaborator. A sampling of some of our other participating institutions include Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), BloodWorks Northwest, Hospital 12 de Octubre, i+12/CNIO (Madrid, Spain), Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST) IRCCS (Meldola, FC \u2013 Italy) / AUSL-Romagna and Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), and Universit\u00e0 di Bologna (Italy) and the NIH in partnership with ASST Spedali Civil di Brescia, Italy and the University of Milano Bicocca-Fondazione MBBM Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Itlay. This list is growing as we continue to work with other investigators globally to collect and sequence valuable patient cohorts.

We believe the adaptive immune system is nature\u2019s most finely tuned diagnostic and therapeutic for most diseases, but the inability to decode it has prevented the medical community from fully leveraging its capabilities. Our proprietary immune medicine platform reveals and translates the massive genetics of the adaptive immune system with scale, precision and speed to develop products in life sciences research, clinical diagnostics, and drug discovery. We have two commercial products, and a robust clinical pipeline to diagnose, monitor and enable the treatment of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune conditions and infectious diseases. Our goal is to develop and commercialize immune-driven clinical products tailored to each individual patient.
