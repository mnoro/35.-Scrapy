The company acquired The Better Bar Company group business in November 2014. Performance The following information was extracted from Good Spirits Hospitality Limited's half year report, released on 28 February 2020: Good Spirits Hospitality Limited (NZX: GSH) announces that its unaudited net profit after tax (NPAT) for the six months to 31 December 2019 was $292,275, compared to an unaudited net profit of $615,259 in the previous corresponding period, a decrease of $(322,984). The decrease has been driven by softer trading conditions in the first half of the year, including labour cost pressures from a rise in the minimum wage and a shortage of skilled chefs in New Zealand and the material impact of the adoption of a new Accounting Standard for Leases (IFRS16). Net revenue for the period was $14,741,294 compared to $12,503,229 for the six months to 31 December 2018, an increase of 18%. On a like for like basis, revenue increased by 3.3%. Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) before significant items was $4,136,147 compared to $2,781,428 in the six months to 31 December 2018, an increase of 48.7%. This was improved by $974,855 for the accounting policy change for leases as discussed below. Removing the positive impact of the accounting policy change EBITDA improved 13.7% when compared to the half year ended 31 December 2018. The underlying NPAT from continuing operations and before significant items (Underlying NPAT) was $558,184 in the reporting period, compared to $724,301 in the previous corresponding period. The impact on underlying NPAT of the change to accounting policy ($171,433) wholly accounted for the deterioration in underlying NPAT when compared to the half year ended 31 December 2018. There were significant items consisting of finance department restructuring and advisory costs after tax of $(265,909) in the period compared to acquisition costs after tax of $(85,931) in the previous period. Operating cash flow was $1,625,569 compared to $1,501,815 in the previous period. Disclaimer: This section is provided as general information only.
