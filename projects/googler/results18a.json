The UK\u2019s largest water supplier gave \u201ccareful consideration\u201d to joining the industry\u2019s first rebellion against Ofwat, in which three major water utilities plan to challenge the regulator. Anglian Water and Northumbrian Water have followed the lead of Yorkshire Water, which earlier this week became the first major water utility to call for the competition watchdog to intervene in the spat over profits. Yorkshire Water challenges regulator over price controls Read more The Thames Water board met to discuss whether to refer their own price regulation to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) before deciding that the process could lead to \u201csignificant management distraction\u201d while it works to improve its service. Thames has weathered multiple run-ins with the regulator in recent years over its poor record on tackling leaks and pollution . In the past the utility was accused of profiteering from its customers by paying out rich dividends to investors and virtually no tax. \u201cIt was deemed to be in the best interests of both customers and employees to accept the final determination, to ensure certainty in the months and years ahead, and to move forward positively and constructively,\u201d the company said. Ofwat sets the price controls every five years to decide how much money people should pay for their water and the level of service they should receive. This also determines how much profit utilities can make for their investors and shareholders. The dissenting firms claim Ofwat\u2019s price review could damage long-term investment in the sector by forcing companies to observe tougher industry targets while cutting spending and water bills. The plans could also lead to underinvestment in the UK\u2019s water system, which would pose a risk to customers and the environment, the companies have said. The CMA said it expects to take six months to rule on whether the price controls were fair but the inquiry could take longer. Kip Meek, the chair of the inquiry, said: \u201cEveryone needs water, so it\u2019s really important that customers\u2019 bills are not set too high, but at the same time the water companies have enough money to deliver an efficient and high-quality service. The CMA will look closely at whether Ofwat\u2019s decision strikes the right balance in this and other areas and will make changes if not.\u201d Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Last year Ofwat called for all water companies in England and Wales to cut bills for customers by \u00a350 over the next five years , while spending \u00a351bn on improving services and infrastructure. The industry had hoped to spend \u00a356bn to meet the new performance targets, which include plugging leaks and guarding against pollution, but this could risk higher bills for households. All other water companies have accepted the tough new Ofwat standards, including the listed water giants United Utilities and Severn Trent, plus Pennon\u2019s South West Water. Rachel Fletcher, Ofwat\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cSome investors have accepted this scale of ambition and change but others need to face up to the new reality. \u201cWe are ready to fully engage with the CMA, setting out our analysis and why we are confident this is the right settlement for customers, the environment and companies.\u201d Topics Utilities Water bills United Utilities Severn Trent Consumer affairs Household bills Water news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Parts of England could run out of water within 20 years, warn MPs Water firms not addressing problem of leaks, causing loss of 3bn litres a day, report finds Published: 10 Jul 2020 Parts of England could run out of water within 20 years, warn MPs Thames Water former boss handed \u00a32.8m since being sacked Steve Robertson received \u00a32m payoff on top of \u00a3777,500 for loss of notice despite being sacked over leakages Published: 5 Jul 2020 Thames Water former boss handed \u00a32.8m since being sacked England's privatised water firms paid \u00a357bn in dividends since 1991 Critics say utilities borrowing to pay shareholders instead of improving infrastructure Published: 1 Jul 2020 England's privatised water firms paid \u00a357bn in dividends since 1991 England's sewerage: what the water companies have to say Firms including Anglian Water respond to data on their practices and policies Published: 1 Jul 2020 England's sewerage: what the water companies have to say Severn Trent to spend \u00a31.2bn on protecting the environment Published: 4 Mar 2020 Severn Trent to spend \u00a31.2bn on protecting the environment Yorkshire Water challenges regulator over price controls Published: 10 Feb 2020 Yorkshire Water challenges regulator over price controls Water companies would be best advised to swallow their medicine Nils Pratley Published: 16 Dec 2019 Published: 16 Dec 2019 Water companies would be best advised to swallow their medicine UK water companies ordered to cut bills by \u00a350 by 2025 Published: 16 Dec 2019 UK water companies ordered to cut bills by \u00a350 by 2025 More more on this story Most popular Business Economics Banking Money Markets Project Syndicate B2B Retail News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
