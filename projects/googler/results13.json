The company acquired The Better Bar Company group business in November 2014. Performance The following information was extracted from Good Spirits Hospitality Limited's half year report, released on 28 February 2020: Good Spirits Hospitality Limited (NZX: GSH) announces that its unaudited net profit after tax (NPAT) for the six months to 31 December 2019 was $292,275, compared to an unaudited net profit of $615,259 in the previous corresponding period, a decrease of $(322,984). The decrease has been driven by softer trading conditions in the first half of the year, including labour cost pressures from a rise in the minimum wage and a shortage of skilled chefs in New Zealand and the material impact of the adoption of a new Accounting Standard for Leases (IFRS16). Net revenue for the period was $14,741,294 compared to $12,503,229 for the six months to 31 December 2018, an increase of 18%. On a like for like basis, revenue increased by 3.3%. Earnings before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) before significant items was $4,136,147 compared to $2,781,428 in the six months to 31 December 2018, an increase of 48.7%. This was improved by $974,855 for the accounting policy change for leases as discussed below. Removing the positive impact of the accounting policy change EBITDA improved 13.7% when compared to the half year ended 31 December 2018. The underlying NPAT from continuing operations and before significant items (Underlying NPAT) was $558,184 in the reporting period, compared to $724,301 in the previous corresponding period. The impact on underlying NPAT of the change to accounting policy ($171,433) wholly accounted for the deterioration in underlying NPAT when compared to the half year ended 31 December 2018. There were significant items consisting of finance department restructuring and advisory costs after tax of $(265,909) in the period compared to acquisition costs after tax of $(85,931) in the previous period. Operating cash flow was $1,625,569 compared to $1,501,815 in the previous period. Disclaimer: This section is provided as general information only.

The action concerns alleged use of so-called \"defeat devices\" to mask vehicles' diesel pollution output. Engines used by Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep, as well as CNH's Iveco trucks are the focus of the probe. UK authorities have also asked two firms in London to provide documents. Fiat-Chrysler Automobile (FCA) and CNH Industrial (CNH) are both controlled by Exor, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family. Lawsuit alleges defeat devices in Nissan petrol cars Volkswagen loses landmark German 'dieselgate' case A statement from Eurojust, a European Union agency for criminal cooperation across member states, said the probe is looking into a \"number of people\" who may have been involved in allegedly allowing use of the devices. It did not name them. The raids, initiated by German prosecutors investigating emissions fraud, involve claims that defeat devices were used in engine management software in 200,000 vehicles. Use of software to flatter emissions levels hit the headlines over the Volkswagen \"diselegate\" affair. Defeat devices allow engines to meet pollution levels under laboratory tests, but shut down the emissions control system in real-world driving conditions. UK documents Eurojust did not name the companies raided. However, FCA and CNH issued similar statements, acknowledging that investigators had turned up at several offices in Europe, and that they are cooperating fully with authorities. Eurojust also said that \"UK authorities have ordered two companies in London to produce relevant documents\". Again, these companies were not named. The statement said: \"Defeat devices are illegal according to the European Union regulations in place. Vehicles with defeat devices are not approved for road usage in the EU and consumers with such devices installed in their cars face possible driving bans.\" Wednesday's raids were at three offices in Germany, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Hesse, three locations in the Piedmont region of Italy, and one location in the Swiss canton of Thurgau. The VW dieselgate scandal broke in 2015, since when Europe's biggest carmaker has paid out \u20ac30bn (\u00a327bn) in fines and been investigated by regulators across the world. In the UK, motorists are involved in legal action for compensation . But VW is far from the only manufacture caught in claims about defeat devices. Nissan, Ford, and Daimler are among many firms whose true emissions levels have been challenged.

Despite the fact we are still far from beating the COVID-19 pandemic, the automakers are increasing their capital spending on the EV segment.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Fiat Chrysler delivered a loss of $1.24 billion during the second quarter, which marks a drop of 232% compared to last year's result. But its Stellantis chapter is set to change its circumstances. After its merger with Groupe PSA, Peugeot's maker (OTC: PUGOY), it will revamp its Warren Truck plant, just outside Detroit, to build the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Once completed, it will add a new product to its Jeep line - a three-row SUV capable of going where there are no roads. FCA is confident it can meet the challenge posed by Ford's new line of Broncos.But Ford's new offering does not have a three-row vehicle. And after the merger, FCAU is set to become the world's fourth largest automaker.Ford Ford's Bronco reboot was unveiled last month, after supposedly receiving 100,000 reservations for the two new models. Also, there is the redesigned Ford F-150 that has been postponed fourth quarter. Ford's Chief Financial Officer, Tim Stone, announced an expected profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter. However, he also warned that the launches of the redesigned F-150, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E will result in the company being in the red during the fourth quarter.But the bottom line is that Ford is poised to be in a much better position for 2021 as several new products will be available for sale. Moreover, Ford recently delivered an unexpected profit of $1.1. billion for its second quarter. But it was due to a one-time $3.5 billion gain on its investment with self-driving software Argo AI, recorded on its statement of financial position as a \"special item,\" as otherwise Ford would have delivered a loss like in the first quarter. Its better-than-expected results were attributed to an efficient operational execution that involved a safe restart of its plants while reducing costs, while its efforts were complemented by a favorable pricing environment.General Motors General Motors also announced that it will boost the production of full-size pickup trucks by 1,000 units per month at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant by expanding its workforce. According to its Chief Financial Officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, GM is at the end of a sweeping change in its truck portfolio. The down time in the last three years is behind GM as this will be its new bright spot. But the giant also left its first quarter profit begin as it swung to an $800 million loss in the second quarter and burned $7.8 billion in cash.Trucks In The Age Of Renewables Overall, there are many developments that pickup truck owners and fans can rejoice in. Moreover, there are many new products to look forward to such as Worksport's product line of solar powered tonneau covers for pickup trucks. Worksport (OTC: WKSP) and its three new technologically advanced light truck tonneau covers will be launched in the U.S very soon. Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling pickup truck for more than four decades. But considering these developments, that may no longer be the case.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

The Italian-American maker of Fiats, Alfa Romeos, Jeeps and Rams said on Friday it slashed advertising costs and saw net prices rise in its key North American market, where it focused on retail sales over lower-margin fleet business. It also cut capital expenditure across the group, and expects to reduce the total for the full year by 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to 8-8.5 billion euros. FCA <FCHA.MI> posted an adjusted loss before interest and tax of 928 million euros for April-June, versus a forecast 1.87 billion euro loss in an analyst poll compiled by Reuters. Earlier in the week, Ford Motor <F.N> reported a second-quarter operating loss of $1.9 billion. General Motors <GM.N> had an operating loss of $1.2 billion. In North America, FCA <FCAU.N> made adjusted earnings before interest and tax of 39 million euros. CEO Mike Manley said production in North America was back to pre-pandemic levels, apart from plants in Warren, Michigan and Toluca, Mexico, which are being retooled for new products. \"We expect a much, much better second half,\" he told investors on a conference call. Milan-listed FCA shares were up 1.5% at 1310 GMT, having been little changed before the results. Manley said the group planned to launch a series of new Jeep models next year, including a new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, and a redesigned Grand Cherokee. Asked about electric pickup trucks coming from its competitors, Manley said FCA was \"very committed\" to electrifying its vehicles, adding: \"Pickup trucks is a key franchise for us. We're not going to sit on the sidelines.\" FCA, which is set to tie-up with Peugeot maker PSA <PEUP.PA> to create Stellantis, the world's fourth largest carmaker, said an ongoing probe by European Commission competition authorities was not expected to delay the merger timetable. Despite the pandemic, PSA earlier this week delivered a profit in the first half of the year. FCA said its industrial free cash flow was minus 4.9 billion euros in the second quarter, with a slightly lower cash burn versus January-March. It finished the quarter with liquidity of 17.5 billion euros. That does not include 4.5 billion euros still available on its loan facility. Ford had liquidity of $40 billion, and GM $31 billion.

Despite the fact we are still far from beating the COVID-19 pandemic, the automakers are increasing their capital spending on the EV segment.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Fiat Chrysler delivered a loss of $1.24 billion during the second quarter, which marks a drop of 232% compared to last year's result. But its Stellantis chapter is set to change its circumstances. After its merger with Groupe PSA, Peugeot's maker (OTC: PUGOY), it will revamp its Warren Truck plant, just outside Detroit, to build the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Once completed, it will add a new product to its Jeep line - a three-row SUV capable of going where there are no roads. FCA is confident it can meet the challenge posed by Ford's new line of Broncos.But Ford's new offering does not have a three-row vehicle. And after the merger, FCAU is set to become the world's fourth largest automaker.Ford Ford's Bronco reboot was unveiled last month, after supposedly receiving 100,000 reservations for the two new models. Also, there is the redesigned Ford F-150 that has been postponed fourth quarter. Ford's Chief Financial Officer, Tim Stone, announced an expected profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter. However, he also warned that the launches of the redesigned F-150, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E will result in the company being in the red during the fourth quarter.But the bottom line is that Ford is poised to be in a much better position for 2021 as several new products will be available for sale. Moreover, Ford recently delivered an unexpected profit of $1.1. billion for its second quarter. But it was due to a one-time $3.5 billion gain on its investment with self-driving software Argo AI, recorded on its statement of financial position as a \"special item,\" as otherwise Ford would have delivered a loss like in the first quarter. Its better-than-expected results were attributed to an efficient operational execution that involved a safe restart of its plants while reducing costs, while its efforts were complemented by a favorable pricing environment.General Motors General Motors also announced that it will boost the production of full-size pickup trucks by 1,000 units per month at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant by expanding its workforce. According to its Chief Financial Officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, GM is at the end of a sweeping change in its truck portfolio. The down time in the last three years is behind GM as this will be its new bright spot. But the giant also left its first quarter profit begin as it swung to an $800 million loss in the second quarter and burned $7.8 billion in cash.Trucks In The Age Of Renewables Overall, there are many developments that pickup truck owners and fans can rejoice in. Moreover, there are many new products to look forward to such as Worksport's product line of solar powered tonneau covers for pickup trucks. Worksport (OTC: WKSP) and its three new technologically advanced light truck tonneau covers will be launched in the U.S very soon. Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling pickup truck for more than four decades. But considering these developments, that may no longer be the case.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

Engines used by Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Jeep vehicles as well as in CNH Industrial's Iveco trucks have been found to contain potentially illegal engine management software to mask excessive pollution levels, Frankfurt prosecutors said. The Frankfurt prosecutor's office stopped short of naming Alfa Romeo and Fiat's parent company, Fiat Chrysler, since under German law only individuals, not companies, can be prosecuted. The investigation targets nine individuals working at an \"internatioal carmaker\" and seeks to establish their role in putting cars equipped with potentially illegal emissions software on public roads the prosecutor's office said. A spokesman for FCA said that a number of the group's offices in Europe were visited by investigators in the context of a request for assistance by magistrates in Germany, adding that it was cooperating fully with authorities. In a similar emailed statement, CNH Industrial confirmed that a number of its offices in Europe have been visited by investigators after a request by German magistrates and that it was cooperating fully with authorities. FCA and CNH Industrial are both controlled by Exor <EXOR.MI>, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family. Potentially illegal software has been detected in the 1.3 litre Multijet and 1.6 litre Multijet engines used in Alfa Romeo, Jeep and Fiat engines as well as in commercial diesel engines used in Iveco and Fiat commercial vehicles, the prosecutors said. Although these cars passed pollution tests in a laboratory, the cars used software to largely switch off exhaust emissions filtering while driving on the road, they added. The investigation, which is coordinated by EU justice agency EUROJUST, focuses on nine individuals living in Italy and their activities between 2014 to 2019, they said.

View more All News Press Releases Benzinga Detroit's Automakers Are Stepping Up Their Truck Game As we enter the second half of 2020, the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE: FCAU), General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) are stepping up their game in the truck and SUV segment. Despite the fact we are still far from beating the COVID-19 pandemic, the automakers are increasing their capital spending on the EV segment.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Fiat Chrysler delivered a loss of $1.24 billion during the second quarter, which marks a drop of 232% compared to last year's result. But its Stellantis chapter is set to change its circumstances. After its merger with Groupe PSA, Peugeot's maker (OTC: PUGOY), it will revamp its Warren Truck plant, just outside Detroit, to build the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Once completed, it will add a new product to its Jeep line - a three-row SUV capable of going where there are no roads. FCA is confident it can meet the challenge posed by Ford's new line of Broncos.But Ford's new offering does not have a three-row vehicle. And after the merger, FCAU is set to become the world's fourth largest automaker.Ford Ford's Bronco reboot was unveiled last month, after supposedly receiving 100,000 reservations for the two new models. Also, there is the redesigned Ford F-150 that has been postponed fourth quarter. Ford's Chief Financial Officer, Tim Stone, announced an expected profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter. However, he also warned that the launches of the redesigned F-150, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E will result in the company being in the red during the fourth quarter.But the bottom line is that Ford is poised to be in a much better position for 2021 as several new products will be available for sale. Moreover, Ford recently delivered an unexpected profit of $1.1. billion for its second quarter. But it was due to a one-time $3.5 billion gain on its investment with self-driving software Argo AI, recorded on its statement of financial position as a \"special item,\" as otherwise Ford would have delivered a loss like in the first quarter. Its better-than-expected results were attributed to an efficient operational execution that involved a safe restart of its plants while reducing costs, while its efforts were complemented by a favorable pricing environment.General Motors General Motors also announced that it will boost the production of full-size pickup trucks by 1,000 units per month at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, plant by expanding its workforce. According to its Chief Financial Officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, GM is at the end of a sweeping change in its truck portfolio. The down time in the last three years is behind GM as this will be its new bright spot. But the giant also left its first quarter profit begin as it swung to an $800 million loss in the second quarter and burned $7.8 billion in cash.Trucks In The Age Of Renewables Overall, there are many developments that pickup truck owners and fans can rejoice in. Moreover, there are many new products to look forward to such as Worksport's product line of solar powered tonneau covers for pickup trucks. Worksport (OTC: WKSP) and its three new technologically advanced light truck tonneau covers will be launched in the U.S very soon. Ford F-150 has been America's best-selling pickup truck for more than four decades. But considering these developments, that may no longer be the case.This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

PSA and FCA said their response to the EU's request for documentation was already in progress, but had been made more complicated to fulfil due to factors including the COVID-19 emergency. It \"will be transmitted shortly\", the two groups said in joint statement. The previous deadline for the EU's decision was Nov. 13. FCA and PSA aim to finalise their merger in the first quarter of next year. It is set to create the world's fourth largest auto maker, to be named \"Stellantis\". The Commission is investigating whether the deal to create the world's fourth-biggest carmaker would hurt competition in small vans in 14 EU countries and Britain.

Bloomberg Tesla Growth Is Musk\u2019s Goal After Profit Opens Path to S&P (Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. managed to stay profitable even in the midst of a global pandemic, but something is still nagging at Elon Musk: the electric-car maker isn\u2019t growing fast enough.The positive quarterly earnings Tesla reported Wednesday were its fourth in a row, again surprising Wall Street analysts and possibly paving the way for its soaring stock to join the S&P 500 Index. But its chief executive officer is in no mood to let his foot off the accelerator, announcing the company will build another new vehicle-assembly plant in Texas and keep lowering the cost of its models.\u201cThe thing that bugs me the most is our cars aren\u2019t affordable enough and we need to fix that,\u201d Musk said during a call with analysts. \u201cWe want to be slightly profitable, maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible. That\u2019s what we want to achieve.\u201dThe results validate the unconventional efforts Musk made to shore up earnings in the midst of the health crisis that\u2019s expected to leave other U.S. automakers posting losses. And the profit further boosted Tesla\u2019s already lofty share price, which has quadrupled since March in part based on speculation the stock could be added to the S&P 500.The shares rose 2.6% to $1,633.99 as of 9:45 a.m. Thursday in New York trading.Musk, 49, announced Tesla would build its second factory in the U.S. near Austin to produce a new battery-powered Cybertruck pickup and the Semi, as well as two existing models for customers on the East Coast. Tesla had been considering an alternate site near Tulsa, Oklahoma, which the CEO said would remain in consideration for future expansion.\u201cI\u2019ve never been more excited or optimistic about Tesla in the history of the company,\u201d Musk said.S&P Calling?Buoyed by optimism about its dominant EV market share and capacity expansion at home and abroad, Tesla\u2019s massive stock gain has vaulted it into the pole position among global automakers.The company reported a profit of 50 cents a share on a GAAP basis, beating analysts\u2019 consensus estimate for a loss of $1.06 a share. Revenue fell from a year ago to $6.04 billion, topping analysts\u2019 expectations for $5.4 billion.The 12-month period of profitability meets criteria that Standard & Poor\u2019s index committee uses when deciding whether to add stocks to the S&P 500. Adding Tesla to the benchmark likely would force money managers who track the index to buy the stock.\u201cTesla was gunning for S&P induction, and they hit their target,\u201d said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have to pull too many rabbits out of the hat to get there. They did it for reasons that are sustainable.\u201dIn a phone call after Tesla\u2019s results were released, Ray McConville, an S&P Dow Jones Indices spokesman, declined to comment on any individual company and said the index isn\u2019t reconstituted on a pre-determined timeline.\u201cCompanies who meet the eligibility requirements are not automatically added to the index,\u201d McConville said. \u201cThey join a pool of other eligible candidates and are considered for inclusion when an opportunity presents itself at which point the index committee takes several factors into account such as sector balance and size representation.\u201dCredit BoostTesla cautioned that achieving its goal of delivering 500,000 vehicles this year has become more difficult. In January, it said it expected to \u201ccomfortably exceed\u201d that level of deliveries for the year.The carmaker handed over 90,650 vehicles in the second quarter, up from 88,400 in the first three months of the year despite a lengthy shut down at its factory in Fremont, California.Tesla\u2019s sales of regulatory credits to other automakers rose to a record $428 million. That contributed to its hearty 25.4% automotive gross margin and cushioned against the negative impact of the coronavirus, which halted production and complicated deliveries.The Palo Alto, California-based company has benefited from mandates requiring automakers to sell electric and other non-polluting vehicles in proportion to their market share, or make up for any deficiency by purchasing credits from other carmakers. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said last year it would pool its fleet with Tesla\u2019s to comply with strict new environmental regulations in Europe.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Competitors buying credits arguably had more to do with Tesla\u2019s 1H profit than the company\u2019s operations. As was the case in 1Q, Tesla\u2019s regulatory credit revenue -- $428 million that essentially has no cost associated with it -- was more than the net, pretax and operating income and free cash flow for the period.\\-- Kevin Tynan, global autos analystClick here to read the researchThe value of those credit sales has been growing, rising from $354 million in the first quarter and $133 million in the last three months of last year. Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said he expects revenue from regulatory credits to double this year from 2019, but eventually the business will fade as other automakers ramp up production of their own battery-powered vehicles.Global PushTesla is speedily transitioning into a global manufacturer, having added a new plant in Shanghai, breaking ground on another in Germany earlier this year and now expanding U.S. capacity with the factory in Texas. Tesla said construction for Model Y lines in the Shanghai factory is progressing as planned, with first deliveries expected in 2021.Musk said demand for Tesla models exceeds supply and that the company\u2019s biggest problem is resolving supply chain snafus.While sales of electric vehicles still account for just a fraction of new-car sales, Tesla has built a commanding lead in the fast-growing market. Global EV sales exceeded 2.1 million vehicles last year, less than 3% of overall car sales but a 40% increase over 2018, according to the International Energy Agency.The Texas plant will allow Tesla expand production in the U.S. -- still its largest market -- as it grows its product lineup and seeks to maintain its advantage over rival automakers plotting their own EV push. Tesla told local officials in Texas it wanted to start construction in the third quarter of this year on a 4 million to 5 million-square-foot plant that will employ 5,000 workers.The earnings give ammunition to Tesla\u2019s investor base and run counter to warnings from short sellers and other critics who doubted the company could end its era of frequent losses.Musk said Wednesday that he aims to remain in the black, but not at the expense of sales growth and vehicle affordability. \u201cWe need to not go bankrupt, but we\u2019re not trying to be super profitable either,\u201d he said.(Updates with stock trading in the fifth paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P. \u00a9 2020 Verizon Media.

The in-depth four-month probe was triggered June 10 after the companies reportedly did not resolve the European competition watchdog's concerns regarding their combined small van units, which would capture a third of the segment in Europe. The FT noted that the companies have been reluctant to sell the divisions, which are highly profitable. The European Commission declined to comment, while Fiat Chrysler and PSA did not immediately respond to S&P Global Market Intelligence's requests for comments. The Commission is set to complete its preliminary review on June 17.

The rating agency said production shutdowns and weak auto demand as a result of the crisis will likely have a negative impact on the French carmaker's revenue and cash flow in 2020. The agency expects the company's financial position to weaken in 2020 before recovering somewhat in 2021 as a result of its planned merger with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. However, Ratings affirmed its BBB- ratings on Peugeot and its senior unsecured debt as the company is supported by a large net cash position with excellent liquidity and no substantial refinancing needs in 2020. By the end of fiscal 2019, Peugeot's net cash was \u20ac10.6 billion. The agency said the crisis will not structurally impair the company's sound financial profile. It added that the current crisis will not affect Peugeot's planned merger with Fiat Chrysler in 2021. Ratings said the merger with Fiat Chrysler could be critical for Peugeot to seize recovery opportunities in markets like the U.S. and Brazil.

Ratings said a downgrade is likely if the company's adjusted EBITDA margins were to fall and stay below 6% for a long period from an average of 9% in 2018-2019. The agency said it could revise its outlook on Peugeot back to stable if production patterns returned to normal in the second half of 2020, particularly in Europe, where Peugeot holds 17% of the market.

The company reported an adjusted operating loss of \u20ac928 million, down from a profit of \u20ac1.53 billion but better than the S&P Global Capital IQ mean consensus estimate of a \u20ac1.97 billion loss. Non-GAAP loss per share was 65 euro cents versus a 59 cents profit in the year-ago period. An adjusted net loss of \u20ac1.04 billion contrasted with a \u20ac928 million profit a year prior but beat a mean of four analysts' estimates. Revenue dropped 56% to \u20ac11.71 billion from \u20ac26.74 billion, while industrial free cash flow slipped to \u20ac4.90 billion from \u20ac5.56 billion. Global vehicle shipments plunged 63% during the quarter in which key North American and European markets were under coronavirus lockdowns that halted production and impeded retail sales. The company recorded a \u20ac39 million adjusted operating profit in the North America region where its Dodge, Ram and Jeep SUV and pickups have been gaining market share. The deepest regional loss came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa at \u20ac589 million, where the company's main revenue drivers include Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia and Maserati. \"While the company remains vigilant about the health and safety of employees, our plants are up and running, dealers are selling in showrooms and online, and we have the flexibility and financial strength to push ahead with our plans,\" CEO Mike Manley said in a statement. The group has increased its liquidity through a three-year \u20ac6.3 billion credit facility obtained through Intesa Sanpaolo and backed by the Italian government. The company said it remained unable to offer full-year guidance given the uncertainty amid the ongoing pandemic. It added that the European Commission's investigation into its proposed merger with Peugeot SA is not expected to delay the deal, which it anticipates closing by the end of the first quarter of 2021. Fiat Chrysler's Milan-traded shares were 1.3% higher at \u20ac8.91 by midafternoon.

The automaker's fleet volume, meaning vehicles owned or leased by a business or organization, remained low in the second quarter as retail deliveries were prioritized.

An S&P Global Market Intelligence analysis found that overall nonseasonally adjusted U.S. vehicle sales for the period totaled 2.95 million units, down from the 2019 figure of 4.42 million units. Passenger car sales declined 46.9% during the period to about 685,168 units from 1.29 million vehicles in the second quarter of 2019. Sales of trucks, minivans and SUVs for the quarter dropped 27.7% to 2.26 million units, compared to 3.13 million in the year-ago period. While major U.S. automakers reported year-over-year declines in sales, they said sales showed signs of recovery in the latter half of the quarter. Detroit-based General Motors Co. sold 492,489 units, down 34% year on year from 746,659 units in the second quarter of 2019. All of the automaker's brands posted year-on-year drops, including Cadillac, which declined 41.4%. GM said demand outpaced supply in the latter half of the second quarter and retail sales recovered significantly in May and June after a decline in April. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV posted a 38.6% decline in total sales for the period to 367,086 vehicles. All of the company's brands were down compared with a year earlier, with the biggest drop from Dodge at 63%. Fiat Chrysler said a stronger-than-expected sales rebound in May and June partially offset the \"economic havoc\" the pandemic caused. \"Retail sales have been rebounding since April as the reopening of the economy, steady gas prices and access to low-interest loans spur people to buy,\" Jeff Kommor, head of U.S. sales at Fiat Chrysler, said in a statement. U.S. sales at Ford Motor Co. decreased 33.3% from the year-ago period to 433,869 units in the quarter. All Ford and Lincoln models posted year-over-year decreases in sales except for the Ford Ranger pickup truck and the Ford Explorer SUV. During the second quarter, Ford's F-Series outsold all the other vehicle brands sold in the U.S., even as its sales fell 22.7% year on year to 180,825 units. GM's Chevrolet Silverado took second place with 122,432, down 14.1% from a year earlier.

General Motors' Mary Barra and Fiat Chrysler's Mike Manley were told to resolve the matter by U.S. District Judge Paul Borman , who called the claim a \"waste of time and resources\" and a \"nuclear option\" during the global coronavirus crisis. \" These legalities will not only divert and consume the attention of key GM and FCA executives from their day jobs \u2014 issues of vehicle production and sales and safety \u2014 but also prevent them from fully providing their vision and leadership on this country's most pressing social justice and health issues,\" Borman said. GM filed the suit against Fiat Chrysler in November 2019, alleging that the Italian-American automaker corrupted labor talks and United Auto Workers contracts in 2009, 2011 and 2015, resulting in it achieving better terms than its competitors. A federal corruption investigation led to the jailing of several union members and FCA executives. GM said it paid billions in incremental labor expenses as Fiat Chrysler won labor concessions in the deal. Fiat Chrysler in a statement said it acknowledged the judge's concerns and would \"look forward to meeting to discuss them and ideally put this matter behind us.\" \"GM has a very strong RICO case and we look forward to constructive dialogue with FCA consistent with the court's order,\" General Motors spokesman Jim Cain reportedly said.

The Italian-American automaker, which posted a smaller-than-expected operating loss for the second quarter, is seeing a significant order book from higher-than-expected vehicle demand and markets recovering more quickly than anticipated, Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley said during the company's earnings call. Order books in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, and Latin America are stronger than before the pandemic, Manley added. The automaker will work through its usual summer production downtime in North America to help meet consumer demand. READ MORE : Sign up for our weekly coronavirus newsletter here , and read our latest coverage on the crisis here . The automaker's negative cash flow for the first half of 2020 was \u20ac 10 billion, with \u20ac 7.3 billion of that from working capital and provisions impacts, CFO and Head of Business Development Richard Palmer said. The CFO expects a \"substantial part\" of the \u20ac 7.3 billion to reverse positively as Fiat Chrysler restores production levels and dealer inventories, especially in North America. CEO Manley said Fiat Chrysler is on track to reduce overall 2020 costs by about \u20ac2 billion. The second half of 2020 will be also impacted by some planned downtime to retool plants for the production of new vehicles, however, Manley said. This will be partly offset by other vehicle launches, including the new Ram TRX pickup truck to be produced in the fourth quarter, he added. \"We expect the launch of these vehicles and numerous other actions the new leadership team has and continues to take to have a solid impact on their financial performance in the fourth quarter,\" Manley said. Fiat Chrysler is also seeing strong customer demand for its electric vehicles, according to Manley, who said the automaker expects to be compliant with Europe's emissions regulations. The CEO also believes automakers will get into the production of batteries for electric vehicles, similar to Tesla Inc., adding that there will be further information from Fiat Chrysler related to that later in the year. \"But that's the way I think that [original equipment manufacturers] should go, personally,\" Manley said.

The rating agency said FCA will likely recover gradually in 2021 following a drop in global vehicle sales in 2020. It also noted the company's low investment-grade business characteristics, including large scale and broad product- and geographic diversification. Fitch said the Italian-American automaker operating margin could decline to about 2% in 2020. The gravity of the impact will depend on the duration and extent of the production stoppages and sales decline as a result of the pandemic. READ MORE : Sign up for our weekly coronavirus newsletter here , and read our latest coverage on the crisis here . In addition, the agency said FCA 's profitability recovery will depend on the success of cost-saving initiatives and new product launches. FCA 's ratings assume that the company's potential merger with Peugeot SA will proceed, Fitch said. \"We believe that this merger will support FCA's credit profile recovery, in a more difficult environment than expected given the pandemic. If the merger does not proceed as planned this will add negative pressure to FCA's rating,\" the agency added. However, Fitch said the plan to pay an exceptional \u20ac5.5 billion dividend to align valuations in the merger will compound free cash flow absorption and weigh significantly on leverage. Funds from operations net leverage could rise to more than 1.5x by the end of 2020. According to Fitch, an upgrade of FCA's ratings is unlikely until the global environment normalizes. However, it said it could still upgrade the ratings if free cash flow margin is around 2% and if funds from operations net leverage is around 0.5x. Meanwhile, the rating agency said it could downgrade the ratings if the merger with Peugeot falls apart, or if free cash flow margin falls below 1% and if funds from operations net leverage goes above 1.5x.

Three analysts interviewed by S&P Global Market Intelligence said the three-month period to June 30, during which the bulk of global auto manufacturing and retail was shuttered amid coronavirus lockdowns, was the most devastating they had witnessed in their career. Of the major automakers with a global presence, analyst polls by S&P Global Market Intelligence show that only South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. are expected to report an operating profit. In absolute terms, U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co. could fare worst with predicted losses of $5 billion, followed by General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. None of the major automakers have been able to offer full-year guidance due to a lack of visibility, but ratings agencies and consultancies have predicted global auto sales to drop 20%-25% in 2020. \"It's not like a normal recessionary scenario where the recession slows activity. This has dropped vertically. That's why we're in unknown territory to a certain extent,\" said Owen Edwards, associate director in the automotive unit at accountancy firm Grant Thornton. \"I would ignore the profitability. It's a question of 'are they cash-strong?' ... Cash management is absolutely critical at this time in order for companies to survive and thrive.\" Edwards said automakers' path out of the recent lockdown could assume a \"W\" shape. This would play out as a strong initial rebound, something already being witnessed in China, followed by a period of slower sales due to weakening consumer confidence that would precede a gradual recovery. Early analyst estimates for the year's remaining two quarters indicate all major carmakers will return to operating profit with the exception of Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., which is in the early stages of a turnaround plan. However, many have announced drastic job losses and reduced investments in new technologies in their efforts to achieve this. As one of the biggest employers and manufacturers in numerous major economies, governments have stepped in to help with measures to spur sales, including subsidies. Unlike a decade ago, many of the countries that have announced such initiatives are making this cash available only for the purchase of hybrid and electric cars, which could limit their intended stimulus effect. Other measures include state loan guarantees, such as a \u20ac5 billion credit line that Renault has secured with backing from the French government . Such help may come at a cost, however, if it leaves automakers increasingly beholden to their helpers, according to Jim Saker, director of the Centre for Automotive Management at the Loughborough University in the U.K. When French President Emmanuel Macron in May declared his ambition for the country to become Europe's top producer of low emission vehicles, he also said domestic automakers should avoid transferring production of locally made cars to other locations. Indications that Honda and Nissan will concentrate more production at home in Japan are further signs of a more nationalistic attitude, Saker said. \"You've got governments involved now trying to influence and stabilize the situation, but also putting massive conditions on what the car manufacturers can do. So in reality, they lose choice of location and they lose product range,\" Saker said, referring to government policies nudging automakers to speed up electrification. \"I've argued for a number of years that the motor industry is no longer in control of its own destiny. Now it's been weakened and I think it's in even less control of its destiny as a result of COVID-19.\" Electric-car maker Tesla Inc. is expected to fare better than its U.S. peers, with analysts at Credit Suisse forecasting a 10% quarter-over-quarter drop in total deliveries. CEO Elon Musk suggested in an internal email seen by Electrek that the company may be able to break even for the quarter with a strong final few days. Tesla's resilience may be in part due to a business model that emphasizes online sales, something that anomalously made it the top-selling brand in the U.K. in April and May as rivals' dealerships were shut. This highlights what Christoph Sturmer, global lead analyst at PwC's Autofacts consultancy, said is a flawed practice in Europe. Rather than dealers selling cars from larger stocks held on their premises, the European market tends to operate in a made-to-order fashion, with sales passed on to manufacturers by dealers, resulting in longer waiting times for final delivery. Some of this is related to cars' higher prices in Europe that prompt buyers to keep within budget by handpicking optional extras that come as standard in some other regions. \"What we see is that the Chinese and U.S. sales model that is more stock-based and offers dealers more independence was much more resilient in the crisis than the more centralized and leaner sales models in Europe,\" Sturmer said. \"Everybody was on the [coronavirus] lockdown but the Chinese and U.S. dealer salesperson just took their mobile phone and called their clients.\" Author Peter Murphy Theme Retail & Consumer Products About Us Quality Program Contact Us Email Subscription Center Press Releases Careers Corporate Responsibility Our History Investor Relations Leadership \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Terms of Use Cookie Notice Privacy Policy Disclosures Do Not Sell My Personal Information"},

The rating agency said the auto sector is among the industries bearing the brunt of the pandemic given its \"sensitivity to consumer demand and sentiment.\" The agency forecasts a meaningful reduction in the demand for new vehicles over the coming months, especially in the markets of Europe, the Middle East, Africa and North America. Moody's said the weaknesses in these companies' credit profiles have left them vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. READ MORE: Sign up for our weekly coronavirus newsletter here , and read our latest coverage on the crisis here . Moody's also placed Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's ratings on review with direction uncertain and downgraded Bayerische Motoren Werke AG's long-term issuer rating to A2 from A1. The German carmaker's ratings are also under review for further downgrade. The agency said its review on Fiat Chrysler balances the challenges the entire auto industry is facing. However, Moody's said it still believes that the Italian American company's proposed merger with Peugeot will result in a higher rating compared to Fiat Chrysler's current rating. Meanwhile, Moody's said its decision to downgrade BMW was driven by the company's already weak positioning in the A1 rating category even before the coronavirus outbreak came to light. In assessing the affected companies' ratings, Moody's said it will look into the outbreak's impact on the automakers' manufacturing operations, including the impact from the temporary closures and the decline in global automotive production. The rating agency said it could consider raising the companies' ratings if the market situation stabilizes, leading to a recovery in metrics, and if adjusted debt/EBITDA drops back sustainably below 1x with an EBITA margin sustainably above 8%. Moody's added that a further downgrade could result from BMW's failure to return to meaningful operating profit generation in the second half of 2020. The agency said it expects to solve the review process within the next three months.

Will coronavirus trigger a global recession? | Jeffrey Frankel Read more The cutbacks came as several other European companies warned that the outbreak was hurting their operations or introduced emergency measures to protect staff. Sky said its offices would bar visitors who had been in high-risk countries in order to reduce the threat of contagion for its staff, with all guests required to complete a form at reception desks. The Italian manufacturer MTA, which makes electrical parts for cars, has been forced to close its factory in Codogno after the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy. It said the closure would have a knock-on effect on production at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s plants in the country before spreading to other carmakers across Europe. The closure of the plant in the Lombardy region would immediately force Fiat to shut production lines at four plants as soon as Wednesday, MTA said. Continued closure would mean all the other Fiat plants in Europe and those of Renault, BMW and Peugeot would close from 2 March. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK\u2019s largest carmaker, and the lorry makers Iveco and CNH, would be affected if the shutdown lasted longer. Diageo, the UK-based owner of Guinness and the world\u2019s biggest whisky producer with brands such as Johnnie Walker, said Covid-19 could hit its profits by up to \u00a3200m as restaurants and bars in China stay shut. Q&A How can I protect myself and others from the coronavirus outbreak? Show Hide The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. The UN agency advises people to: Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers Advice about face masks varies. Wearing them while out and about may offer some protection against both spreading and catching the virus via coughs and sneezes, but it is not a cast-iron guarantee of protection Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days . If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days , to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

FTSE 100 tumbles below 7,000 points as Diageo warns of \u00a3200m coronavirus hit - business live Read more Diageo predicted a decline in profits of \u00a3140m-\u00a3200m in the year to the end of June. Sales are expected to be down by up to \u00a3325m. Its estimates excluded the impact of the coronavirus on other markets beyond Greater China and Asia Pacific. Diageo said the majority of consumption of its products in China took place in bars and restaurants, which mostly remain closed. \u201cWe have seen significant disruption since the end of January, which we expect to last at least into March,\u201d it said. \u201cThereafter we expect a gradual improvement, with consumption returning to normal levels towards [June].\u201d The company also highlighted the impact in South Korea, Japan and Thailand, where events have been postponed, conferences and banquets have been cancelled and a drop in tourism has also had an impact on consumption in bars and restaurants. The significant drop in international air travel, especially across Asia Pacific, has also hurt Diageo\u2019s business, including sales in airports. Danone, the maker of products including Volvic and Evian bottled water, and Activia yoghurts, said it would take a \u20ac100m (\u00a384m) sales hit in the first quarter as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. The French-based company was experiencing a \u201csevere demand slowdown\u201d for its Mizone water brand in China, which is Danone\u2019s second biggest market and accounted for 10% of global sales last year. Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Danone employs 8,200 staff in China and has eight factories, seven of which support its water business. The company said water production resumed on 17 February except for at its factory in Wuhan, which is at the centre of the outbreak. SSP said in the Asia Pacific region, which generates 8% of group revenues, domestic and international air travel relating to China was down 90%, Hong Kong was down 70% and Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines were down 25% to 30%. Its share price fell almost 4% on Wednesday morning and the company said group revenue would be down by \u00a310m-\u00a312m in February, with operating profits down \u00a34m-\u00a35m.

Wading unto the breach and armed with the knowledge of how close capitalism came to a system failure in 2008, they have fired the \u201cbig bazookas\u201d of monetary policy, pumping trillions of dollars into the world\u2019s giant pool of money, effectively creating wealth out of nothing. Since 2 March, the Fed\u2019s total assets have leapt by more than half . Since 2008, its balance sheet has grown to 30% of the size of the US economy. Central bankers seem confident their actions will find public approval. \u201cA firefighter has never been criticised for using too much water,\u201d the governor of the Bank of Canada said . This confidence is misplaced. Both left and right have reason to welcome the Fed\u2019s emergency intervention, but new money flooded into private capital markets will inevitably flow into the deepest pockets. And without strengthening the democratic legitimacy of this policy, and using it for socially transformative ends, the reaction will strengthen those who are antagonistic to the practice of government \u2013 the populist right. The stock market\u2019s worst fears seem to have been allayed by congressional action and the Fed\u2019s promised bond-buying spree In his recent book , the French economist Thomas Piketty observes that central banks have become the only effectively functioning organs of government. He doesn\u2019t mean this as a good thing. \u201cMonetary activism\u201d is financial triage against world economic collapse, but it\u2019s also an avoidance tactic. It works by bracketing democracy and letting the technocrats take over. To make decisions about justice and distribution, discussions about taxation, policy and budgets are needed. As the Fed chairman Jerome Powell put it, the central bank has the power to lend but not to tax and spend. It is up to elected officials to \u201cmake decisions about where we as a society should direct our collective resources\u201d. In the last two months, he has all but begged Congress to be more proactive in shaping the direction and volume of the policy. Progressives have reason to praise central banks for offering evidence that the \u201cmoney printer can go brrr\u201d without any clear limit. Economists see no sign of inflation on the horizon. Some have become concerned about inflation in recent weeks, but others worry about the opposite \u2013 deflation. All the extra liquidity has not managed to translate into meaningful growth. This makes an active role for the state in hiring people in sustainable jobs \u2013 in green energy, construction, arts, healthcare, education \u2013 all the more important. Public spending of the New Deal helped cure the Great Depression in the 1930s, so why not a Green New Deal for this one? Central bankers have emerged as unlikely allies in the fight against climate change. Maybe this latest intervention could finally open them up to the idea of \u201cGreen QE\u201d, (quantitative easing) actively supporting decarbonisation by buying up environmentally friendly bonds. Republicans, for their part, are relieved that the Fed rescued the economy from meltdown, giving Donald Trump at least a chance of campaigning amid a recovery. Though unemployment is stratospheric and hundreds of Americans are still dying of Covid-19, the stock market\u2019s worst fears seem to have been allayed by congressional action and the Fed\u2019s promised bond-buying spree. But neither side should feel secure under the sheltering hand of unelected power like the central bank. The politics of money has a way of quickly becoming about other things. Last month, the German constitutional court concluded in a shock ruling that the European Central Bank may have exceeded its mandate in creating so much cheap credit, threatening the monetary response to the crisis. Within days, Viktor Orb\u00e1n suggested that the Hungarian constitution might trump the decisions of the European Court of Justice in his country\u2019s treatment of refugees. What kind of political creatures could the money-printing of central banks spawn? We have seen hints in the past. A decade ago, the proactive Fed was a target for the Tea Party movement. Republicans directed the backlash to control of the House in 2010 and eventually over Congress. Opposing President Barack Obama, the Republican party acted as a drag on recovery efforts and robust healthcare reform. The US is paying the price for their efforts with a dysfunctional healthcare system in a pandemic in which the victims have been disproportionately African American. There are reasons to think the response to the Fed\u2019s actions from the right might be more extreme this time, not only because the scale of both spending and suffering is greater, but also because the fringe itself has become radicalised. Central banks have no shortage of enemies in waiting. President Trump\u2019s description of the Fed as the \u201c enemy \u201d is designed to rob it of the very democratic legitimacy it cannot live without. Libertarians who reject all forms of \u201cfiat currency\u201d unbacked by precious metals, commonly known as \u201cgold bugs\u201d, have grown in influence over the past years. In the US, the most famous libertarian gold bug is probably Ron Paul, whose demand to \u201cEnd the Fed\u201d ran through his 2008 campaign. His son, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have also voiced support for a gold standard. Returning to currency that is matched by finite gold reserves could act as a lever to lock in austerity, blocking the expansion of credit and state spending that would be necessary to redress inequality. In Germany, another gold bug, a former precious metals consultant, Peter Boehringer, sits in the Bundestag . His party, the Alternative for Germany, was founded by economics professors in 2013 over the politics of money \u2013 they rejected the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy and management of the eurozone crisis. Another erstwhile gold bug now waits in the antechamber of the Fed itself. Until its recent postponement, Congress was scheduled to vote on the nomination of Judy Shelton to the Fed. Citing Ludwig von Mises and his student Friedrich Hayek as her guides , Shelton has called repeatedly in the past for the return to the \u201csound money\u201d of a gold standard before converting to Trump\u2019s loose monetary policy . Pity the central banks' lockdown dilemma: do they fight inflation or deflation? | Larry Elliott Read more For now, alongside the rumblings of a backlash, the actions of the Fed are receiving broad public approval. Elected officials should take this support as a sign that people do not instinctively reject a role for the government in the working of the market under emergency conditions. Lawmakers have time to build on this insight to work with central banks to design economies where uncertainty and hardship are diminished, even after coronavirus has passed. Central banks can be accessories to more equal and just societies, but they can never be the architects. Money must be made to serve the people, not the other way around.

The factory is seen as vulnerable and its owner, PSA, has already stopped investing in it.\nPhotograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Peugeot could demand compensation from the British government to keep its Vauxhall factory in Ellesmere Port open in the event of a bad Brexit deal, its chief executive has said. Carlos Tavares, the head of Peugeot\u2019s owner, PSA, said the carmaker\u2019s European workers should not be forced to bear the costs of \u201ccustoms barriers\u201d between the UK and the EU when the transition period finishes at the end of the year. Carmakers have voiced concerns about the future trading relationship between the UK and EU, with repeated warnings that tariffs and customs checks could threaten the survival of large parts of the industry. The Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire, which employs about 1,000 people, is seen as particularly vulnerable because a decision on building a new Vauxhall Astra model is overdue. PSA, which is merging with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , has already stopped investment in the factory. In a call with journalists on Tuesday, Tavares said: \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t find a business case \u2026 we would have to ask the UK government to compensate for that, because it is not ethically acceptable that we ask the continental European workers to pay for the customs barriers to enter the UK market. \u201cThere is a point in time that the UK government needs also to respect its own people by creating conditions for the business in the UK to fly.\u201d Tavares\u2019s comments came as carmakers arranged phone calls and online launch events to replace the Geneva motor show , which was cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak that has already rocked the global car industry. BMW executives swapped handshakes for fist bumps as they unveiled their new i4 electric car concept, a version of which is due to go on sale next year. The presentation was streamed from its Munich headquarters a day after the company quarantined 150 research and development employees after a colleague caught the virus. On a call with journalists, Ola K\u00e4llenius, the chairman of the Mercedes-Benz owner, Daimler, said the company had been gradually increasing production at its Beijing plant since 10 February. The outbreak had highlighted the need to track supply chains back to source, he added. \u201cThis is really day-by-day management,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is too early to tell what the full impact will be.\u201d Tavares said coronavirus had been a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for carmakers that they must take control of battery supply chains that are heavily dependent on China. Peugeot had been forced to step in to help a South Korean battery producer to increase production at a factory in Poland, with supply chains creaking. Shutdowns of battery materials plants in China in particular could make it more difficult for carmakers to hit EU emissions targets this year and next , according to Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based independent automotive analyst. Under the rules, which came into force at the start of the year, carmakers must reduce average carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold in the EU below an average of 95g per kilometre, or face steep fines. China is the world\u2019s key centre for battery manufacture. Of 442 companies involved in the automotive battery supply chain, 207 are based in China, according to the data supplier MarkLines. Honda said on Tuesday it was temporarily cutting production at its factory in Saitama, Japan, because of difficulties sourcing parts. The British supercar maker McLaren said it was flying in parts to bypass problems in its supply chain. As well as supplies, the outbreak has already hit carmakers\u2019 revenues. Sales have plummeted in China, after the world\u2019s largest car market virtually ground to a halt in early February as quarantine conditions were imposed. European and US sales could also be affected as the virus spreads.

The carmakers argue that subsidies would help kickstart demand as lockdown measures ease and factories reopen, preventing tens of thousands of job losses amid a global slump in car orders . Bosses such as BMW\u2019s chief executive, Oliver Zipse, have publicly called for grant support to apply across traditional internal combustion engines as well as battery-powered cars and hybrids. The heads of European carmakers including BMW, Daimler, Fiat Chrysler and Jaguar Land Rover discussed the plans last week with Frans Timmermans, the European commission\u2019s executive vice-president for the green deal. The carmakers pushed for a Europe-wide scheme part-funded from the EU budget. Last month Timmermans backed tying carbon dioxide emission limits to any subsidy package, but the carmakers have called for a coordinated stimulus across EU countries that would apply to all cars that meet the Euro 6d standard, effectively meaning any new car would be eligible. In the UK, the car industry has focused its efforts on allowing car dealerships to reopen , but the Vauxhall owner Peugeot confirmed that early discussions over a stimulus scheme covering both battery and internal combustion cars were under way. Talks are being led by the business department under Alok Sharma. The UK already subsidises the sale of battery electric cars , which are generally more expensive than internal combustion cars. Environmental campaign groups have said giving subsidies to all cars would be a missed opportunity to promote a green recovery and to help carmakers move towards all-electric cars with zero carbon dioxide exhaust emissions . Greenpeace said any subsidies should be targeted at less wealthy people and should be conditional on internal combustion engine production ending by 2028. \u201cOnly purely electric, small and light vehicles should be eligible,\u201d said Lorelei Limousin, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace. \u201cIf the green recovery means something, these should be binding conditions across the EU. Any financial support for the car industry should also be conditional on the sector taking concrete steps to rapidly end its growing impact on climate breakdown and our health.\u201d A rise in SUVs has meant average car emissions have risen even as combustion engines have become much more efficient. In other words, a scrappage scheme meant to push consumers towards newer cars could raise emissions. \u201cWe need to encourage carmakers to take the leap into electric vehicles rather than help them finance getting rid of their SUV and high-emissions vehicle stocks,\u201d said Pascal Canfin, a French MEP for the liberal Renew Europe group who chairs the European parliament\u2019s environment committee. He added that support should not \u201crepeat the same mistake we did after the 2009 financial crisis, when we reinvested in the economy but deprioritised the environmental crisis. We lost a decade. Today, we do not have a decade left to lose.\u201d Any increase in demand for cars with higher carbon dioxide emissions would run contrary to the direction of travel for the European industry. Under regulations that came into effect at the start of 2020, carmakers who fail to meet carbon dioxide reduction targets will be fined. The UK is planning to mirror the regulations . Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk Julia Poliscanova, the clean vehicles director at the campaign group Transport & Environment, said subsidies must not endanger the recent progress made on electric vehicle sales because of the rules. Electric car sales across Europe doubled year-on-year in the first three months of 2020, according to industry data.

Sales in March were 203,000 down on the same month a year earlier, according to data released by the industry body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). March is traditionally one of the strongest months of the year for new car sales because of the release of new number plates. However, this was the weakest March since the late 90s, when the twice-yearly number plate change was introduced. Britain\u2019s car industry was already struggling before the pandemic \u2013 hit by a combination of falling sales, a shift away from diesel vehicles and Brexit uncertainty. Quick guide UK government support for workers and businesses during the coronavirus crisis Show Hide Income subsidies Direct cash grants for self-employed people, worth 80% of average profits, up to \u00a32,500 a month. There are similar wage subsidies for employees. Loan guarantees for business Government to back \u00a3330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to \u00a35m with no interest for six months for smaller companies. Business rates Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms. Cash grants Britain\u2019s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of \u00a310,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of \u00a325,000. Benefits Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by \u00a31,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits. Sick pay Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above \u00a394.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills. Other Local authorities to get a \u00a3500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief. Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback. The figures are a stark indication of what happens when economies grind to a halt, said Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT. \u201cHow long the market remains stalled is uncertain but it will reopen and the products will be there. In the meantime, we will continue to work with government to do all we can to ensure the thousands of people employed in this sector are ready for work,\u201d he said. Dramatic falls in new car sales have been reported in other European countries that introduced lockdowns earlier than Britain, including Italy, where sales fell 85% in March, France, down 72%, and Spain, which was 69% lower. The second quarter will be the most difficult for the auto industry, according to the investment bank JP Morgan, which has downgraded its global car production forecast for Europe , the Americas and China from 9% to a 19% fall compared with 2019. Forecasts suggest the continued closure of car plants across Europe and North America will cost the auto industry more than $100bn (\u00a382bn) in lost revenues if the shutdown lasts until the end of April. All major European carmakers have suspended production because of disruption caused by the spread of the coronavirus and if this continues as expected until the end of April, this will account for \u20ac66bn (\u00a358bn) in lost sales in Europe, or 2.6m cars. In North America it would lead to lost sales of about $52bn (\u00a342bn), or 2m cars. The calculations have been made by Ian Henry, the owner of the consultancy AutoAnalysis, who produces forecasts for the SMMT, along with the automotive team at consultancy GlobalData. Assembly lines ground to a halt in March as the lockdown across Europe disrupted global supply chains, and analysts predicted large falls in demand in all key markets. Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk All volume manufacturers from BMW to Toyota and Nissan to Jaguar Land Rover sent their workers home after the worsening outbreak on the continent led companies to examine the health implications for their workers . The story was repeated across North America as the Detroit carmakers, including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, shut down their plants . Auto firms initially closed their sites for a number of weeks, saying they would keep the situation under review, but the shutdown is anticipated to last longer than first expected. Henry predicts that each additional week of plant closures in Europe will cost the industry an extra \u20ac8bn (\u00a37bn) in lost production value and similarly $7.5bn (\u00a36bn) in North America. International supply chains complicate the question of when car plants can reopen, Henry said, while it is also difficult to predict when consumers will starting buying cars again. \u201cWhat will be the state of consumer demand after this?\u201d Henry said. \u201cWill the man in the street want to buy a new car? A huge proportion of cars go to companies and fleet managers won\u2019t be looking to buy cars for executives.\u201d Topics Automotive industry BMW Toyota Nissan Jaguar Land Rover Europe Coronavirus outbreak news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story New car sales rise in UK after coronavirus lockdown decline Year-on-year July increase comes as dealerships and factories started to reopen Published: 5 Aug 2020 New car sales rise in UK after coronavirus lockdown decline Northern Ireland to be left out of new UK car emission restrictions Quirk in regulations means vehicles sold there will count as EU sales for strict CO2 limit Published: 2 Aug 2020 Northern Ireland to be left out of new UK car emission restrictions UK car dealership Pendragon to cut 1,800 jobs Owner of dealers such as Evans Halshaw to shed head office and showroom staff as Covid-19 deepens industry crisis Published: 30 Jul 2020 UK car dealership Pendragon to cut 1,800 jobs UK gives Ford \u00a3500m in loan guarantees to support exports Move comes before Bridgend plant is shut by US carmaker but \u2018safeguards jobs\u2019 elsewhere Published: 22 Jul 2020 UK gives Ford \u00a3500m in loan guarantees to support exports Aston Martin raises \u00a3207m in equity and debt after sales slump Published: 26 Jun 2020 Aston Martin raises \u00a3207m in equity and debt after sales slump UK car industry 'could lose one in six jobs due to Covid-19 crisis' Published: 23 Jun 2020 UK car industry 'could lose one in six jobs due to Covid-19 crisis' Jaguar Land Rover to cut more than 1,000 agency staff in UK Published: 15 Jun 2020 Jaguar Land Rover to cut more than 1,000 agency staff in UK Lookers auditor resigns as car dealership delays results again Published: 8 Jun 2020 Lookers auditor resigns as car dealership delays results again More more on this story Most popular World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Honda, BMW and Toyota joined a rapidly lengthening list of carmakers halting European operations on Wednesday, Jaguar Land Rover , the UK\u2019s largest auto firm, as the only one still operating UK plants. The latest closures mean the coronavirus outbreak has temporarily stopped the production lines at plants that employ about 20,000 workers and make more than 1m of the UK car industry\u2019s annual output of 1.5m vehicles. As the pandemic brought the automotive industry grinding to a virtual halt , the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders\u2019 (SMMT) chief executive, Mike Hawes, warned that the industry \u201cstands on the precipice\u201d. Automotive experts voiced concerns that the UK car industry, already struggling to avert decline, may not regain lost ground once the outbreak is over. \u201cLast year, with the uncertainty over Brexit, the shift away from China [amid falling sales] and diesel, it was the perfect storm. This is perfect storm part two,\u201d said Prof David Bailey of Birmingham Business School. \u201cAs assemblers [manufacturers] shut down, it has a cascade effect on the supply chain and some of those firms will have to start shutting down too. \u201cThe fear is a scarring effect. If capacity is lost because of shutdowns, the longer that they go on, the more there is likely to be a permanent impact on an industry that has already been struggling.\u201d He urged the government to consider a wage subsidy scheme to prevent workers being laid off and losing capacity in the sector permanently. Prof Karel Williams at Manchester Business School said it was likely the UK car industry would emerge from the coronavirus crisis smaller than it otherwise would have been. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from what Volkswagen has been saying that lost sales will not be found again and there will be a massive hit in terms of loss-making in the major carmakers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe markets will recover but the companies will be weakened just when they\u2019re requiring large-scale investments in electrification. That will force them to rethink their portfolios of factories, models and markets.\u201d He said existing weakness in the UK auto sector meant firms may sacrifice their British operations to aid their long-term recovery. \u201cThe review of factories, models and markets is not going to be good for the British car industry,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe last thing the industry needs is a major disruption to both demand and supply. The more marginal the operations, the model and the market, the more likely things are to be cut.\u201d About 20,000 UK car workers have been sent home temporarily across the UK industry, while Mercedes-Benz parent, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot have announced broader suspensions of European output. Jaguar Land Rover kept its UK sites operating but has frozen output at its Slovak factory. The suspensions announced on Wednesday will affect Honda\u2019s Swindon plant, already earmarked for closure in 2022, BMW\u2019s Mini plant at Cowley in Oxfordshire and Toyota\u2019s plant at Burnaston in Derbyshire. The three sites employ more than 11,000 people and produce more than 500,000 cars between them annually. UK manufacturers to regear factories to build ventilators for NHS Read more BMW\u2019s chief executive, Oliver Zipse, said the interruption was expected to last until 19 April, while Honda\u2019s will run until at least 6 April. BMW said profits this year would be significantly lower due to the interruptions at plants that accounted for half of the 2.6m cars it built in 2019. Toyota stopped output at more of its plants in Europe and Asia, including factories in Poland, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Jaguar Land Rover, which has plants at Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Halewood,is responsible for almost all of the UK\u2019s remaining production capacity. The firm said it was following government advice but had not yet decided to stop work at UK factories, although work at Nitra in Slovakia will be suspended. The fresh suspensions come a day after Nissan closed its Sunderland factory , Britain\u2019s biggest car plant \u2013 joining the aerospace giant Airbus in ceasing production.

Now, at the age of 85, the tycoon is about to embark on what might be his biggest one to date \u2013 launching a newspaper in the midst of a serious financial slump. De Benedetti wants the newspaper, due to launch online and in print in mid-September, to be a progressive, independent voice in a market weighed down by political and economic influence. And, as its name \u2013 Domani (Tomorrow) \u2013 suggests, the focus will be on coverage that looks to the future. News Corp posts US$1.5bn loss driven by sharp declines in newspaper revenue Read more \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean to say that we won\u2019t take into account historical references,\u201d he told the Observer . \u201cThis will be a post-Covid 19 newspaper born alongside the hope for the country\u2019s reconstruction.\u201d The ambitious project, with newspapers struggling with a drop in advertising as a result of the pandemic, will be funded by De Benedetti using \u20ac20m of his own money before transferring ownership to a foundation. \u201cIt will be the only Italian newspaper owned by a foundation, and one of the few in Europe, including the Guardian ,\u201d he said. \u201cThe foundation will secure the absolute independence of the newspaper.\u201d The newspaper\u2019s success will depend on subscribers \u2013 the website will start immediately with a paywall while print version will contain 16 pages. Despite a cluttered market in Italy , De Benedetti believes there is room for a newspaper that focuses on \u201cfacts, not chatter\u201d, and which is not owned by someone with outside economic interests or linked to a political party. De Benedetti, who made his fortune at Olivetti, the electronics group, stepped down as chairman of all his industrial and media companies in 2009. In 2012, he transferred his stake in GEDI, the media group that owns La Repubblica and La Stampa , to his three sons. He tried to regain control last year, after publicly criticising his sons\u2019 management of the business. But his bid was rejected and the group\u2019s ownership went to the Elkann-Agnelli family, owners of Fiat, the car manufacturer, and Juventus football club. De Benedetti said that changes in newspaper ownership in recent years have left a gap in the market for a liberal, progressive voice: \u201cToday, the scenario of Italian newspapers is characterised by the point of view of the owner, one who has a prevalent economic interest outside of the newspaper \u2013 this for me is wrong.\u201d This will be a newspaper against inequality, on the side of the weakest in society and critical of all powers \u2013 economic and political Carlo De Benedetti And he added: \u201cAlso in Italy, newspapers are either rightwing or centre, there is no longer a newspaper that reflects the liberal world.\u201d Seventeen journalists, including a German speaker, have been hired to work at Domani , which will be based in Rome and edited by 35-year-old Stefano Feltri. The newspaper will be pro-European \u2013 De Benedetti said that Italy outside of Europe would be like \u201ca ship lost in the Mediterranean\u201d \u2013 and focus on the environment, economics and international affairs. \u201cOf course, we will write about politics too, but we\u2019re not interested in political brawling or chatter \u2013 for years, newspapers have been full of political chat that no longer interests anyone,\u201d De Benedetti said. \u201cThis will be a newspaper against inequality, on the side of the weakest in society and critical of all powers \u2013 economic and political.\u201d Domani will also focus more on news and facts, rather than opinion: \u201cThere is place for opinion pieces in a newspaper, but they need to be distinct from facts,\u201d he said. The environment will be among the main issues in the newspaper\u2019s coverage, he added: \u201cMy generation has contributed towards ruining the world. I want my final venture to be a contribution towards not repeating the mistakes of the past.\u201d Topics Newspapers The Observer Italy Europe Newspapers & magazines news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content Most popular World Europe US Americas Asia Australia Middle East Africa Inequality Global development News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Modern Slavery Act Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Patrons Discount Codes Support The\u00a0Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top \u00a9 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The shutdown in China has disrupted the global supply chain as carmakers struggle to source the tens of thousands of parts needed for each car. This week, Ralf Speth, the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said the company had been forced to fly parts in suitcases from China to the UK as supplies continued to dwindle. Fiat Chrysler has warned it could halt production at one of its four European plants if the supply from China continues to be affected. Toyota and Peugeot-Citroen said their supply chains may be affected but neither expected to close UK plants as a result.

Photograph: Mohamed Azakir/Reuters ....followed by Carole Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images Updated at 4.26pm GMT Facebook Twitter 4.07pm GMT 16:07 Carlos Ghosn: What we learned...and what we didn't It was billed as a press conference, but Carlos Ghosn\u2019s long-awaited appearance before the world\u2019s media also felt like a courtroom, with a Powerpoint presentation thrown in too. But this courtroom, unlike the one he has avoided in Tokyo, gave the defendant free rein to explain why he\u2019s innocent, M\u2019Lud. Ghosn spent an hour presenting his own case, and then fended off suggestions that his fugitive status implies guilt. But what did we learn? 1) Ghosn blames a conspiracy between Nissan executives and forces within the Japanese government to bring him down. He named former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, whistleblower Hari Nada and board member Masakazu Toyoda, adding: My unimaginable ordeal is the result of a handful of unscrupulous, vindictive individuals. He refused to name which government officials are to blame, beyond appearing to absolve PM Shinzo Abe. 2) Japan\u2019s judicial system is in the spotlight. Ghosn makes a fair point when he criticises the Japanese habit of forcing confessions out of those accused of crimes. Pouring out his anguish, the former CEO said: I was brutally taken from my work as I knew it, ripped from my work, my family and my friends. It is impossible to express the depth of that deprivation and my profound appreciation to be able to be reunited with my family and loved ones. (I was) interrogated for up eight hours a day without any lawyers present. \u2018It will get worse for you if you don\u2019t just confess\u2019, the prosecutor told me repeatedly. 3) Ghosn claims he has proof that he\u2019s innocent . Reporters were shown some documents which -- apparently -- explain away the $11m of dubious expense payments. He also produced a letter approving the houses bought for the Ghosn family, signed by Saikawa. Ghosn says he plans to prove his innocence. I don\u2019t consider myself as a prisoner in Lebanon. I prefer this prison to the one before. I am ready to stay a long time in Lebanon, but I am going to fight because I have to clear my name. 4) He\u2019s burned his bridges in Japan. Savaging the Tokyo prosecutor is one thing. But citing Pearl Harbor as an example of Japanese cunning and secrecy is to deploy the diplomatic skills of Basil Fawlty. Ghosn\u2019s point is that he didn\u2019t spot how his one-time allies were plotting to boot him out, to break Renault\u2019s control over Nissan - and scupper a planned merged with Fiat-Crysler. But still, it was a poor analogy that will distract from Ghosn\u2019s claims of innocence. 5) He\u2019s devoted to Mrs Ghosn. I think Ghosn was trying to be chivalrous when he joked that he missed his wife badly when he was trapped in Japan, even if others might not . As he touchingly put it: I\u2019ve been in a kind of nightmare for 13 months. It started when I saw the face of the prosecutor, and it ended when I saw the face of my wife. This love is not unrequited -- Carole has spoken about how her husband\u2019s return was a \u201cbeautiful surprise\u201d . They share something else too -- charges in Japan. In her case, prosecutors claim she committed perjury last year. Former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn arrives with his wife Carole today Photograph: -/AFP via Getty Images 6) Lebanon might not be as safe as he hoped. Fleeing to Beirut looked like a cunning plan, as there\u2019s no extradition treaty with Japan. But there is a law banning travel to Israel, which Ghosn has broken in the past. Beirut\u2019s prosecutor wants to discuss this with Ghosn tomorrow, alongside the Red Notice issued by Interpol for his arrest. 7) Be honest, you were hoping to hear Ghosn confirm whether he was bundled out of Toyko in a big musical box. I certainly was . But on this point, he remained tight-lipped. Perhaps he\u2019s saving it for the film version (although he denies that there\u2019s a deal with Netflix). Updated at 4.14pm GMT Facebook Twitter 3.26pm GMT 15:26 After two and half hours, Carlos Ghosn\u2019s press conference is ending as it began, with the former car chief insisting he is innocent. If I\u2019d had any hope of a fair trial, I\u2019d never have fled, he says. He also criticises prosecutors for issuing an arrest warrant for his wife Carole, for allegedly giving false information. Why do that nine months afterwards? And with that, he\u2019s finished. Facebook Twitter 3.21pm GMT 15:21 Q: Are you the Dreyfus of Lebanon? Ghosn says he doesn\u2019t understand the reference (to Alfred Dreyfus, the French captain, who was wrongly convicted of passing military secrets to Germany). Q: It means are you a victim? Yes I am, says Ghosn firmly. He says that several law professors say they cannot understand why he was arrested, especially as some of the alleged financial misconduct refers to money that wasn\u2019t even paid out. Facebook Twitter 3.17pm GMT 15:17 Ghosn: It's been a 13-month nightmare Q: What were your emotions during your escape? Ghosn says he was numb, from the start of the drama until he met his wife Carole in her parents\u2019 home in the Lebanon. I\u2019ve been in a kind of nightmare for 13 months. It started when I saw the face of the prosecutor, and it ended when I saw the face of my wife. Q: Would you recommend a packing case as a mode of travel? Ghosn breaks into a grin, but won\u2019t confirm that rumour that he was smuggled out of Japan in a large box. Facebook Twitter 3.13pm GMT 15:13 Q: Can the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi alliance succeed without you? Yes, says Ghosn modestly - but it needs to follow some rules. Facebook Twitter 3.13pm GMT 15:13 Ghosn says he is ready to answer questions from the French authorities, who last year launched an inquiry into his wealth . Facebook Twitter 3.09pm GMT 15:09 Incidentally, the much-pined-after Carole Ghosn is attending today\u2019s press conference, supporting her man. Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP via Getty Images Facebook Twitter 3.06pm GMT 15:06 Ghosn: I missed my wife (even if you wouldn't) Associated Press asks Ghosn what triggered his decision to escape Japan. Ghosn says there were two factors. First, the Tokyo prosecutor kept postponing his trial, saying it wouldn\u2019t begin until 2021. Second, he missed his wife Carole, telling reporters that: For many people, it wouldn\u2019t be a punishment not to see their wife. But for me it was. How sweet. And yet, how rude! Updated at 3.09pm GMT Facebook Twitter 3.01pm GMT 15:01 Channel Four asks Ghosn about the damage to his reputation: Q: Won\u2019t people say that \u2018if a man escapes from a trial in a box there\u2019s no smoke without fire\u2019? Ghosn won\u2019t be lured into confirming the details of his escape. He says many lies have been told about him, and repeats that he wants a fair trial over the claims of financial misconduct. Updated at 3.01pm GMT Facebook Twitter 2.59pm GMT 14:59 Ghosn has reiterated that he had talked to Fiat-Chrysler about a possible merger with Renault, but the deal floundered after his arrest (allowing Peugeot to swoop in instead). Facebook Twitter 2.56pm GMT 14:56 Curiously, Ghosn denies that he resigned from Renault, saying such reports are a \u201ctravesty\u201d. That\u2019s odd, as France\u2019s finance minister Bruno Le Maire announced a year ago that Ghosn had quit as Renault\u2019s chairman and CEO . Renault also announced that he had resigned both roles , but remained as a director.

Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) Some investors have been confused by remarks. To clarify, I am confident the president will do the right thing in temporarily shutting down the country and closing the borders. If that happens, we can win the war against the virus and the markets and the economy will soar. March 18, 2020 He might be right - which his $1.7bn bank balance suggests. But don\u2019t expect stock markets or the economy to \u201csoar\u201d anytime soon. JP Morgan has slashed and burned its forecasts for US economic growth. It now expects gross domestic product - the broadest measure of the economy - to shrink by -4.0% in the first quarter and by -14.0% in the second quarter!

It\u2019s quite something: \u201cHell is coming!\u201d Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s wrong. Facebook Twitter 6.22pm GMT 18:22 US airlines want $50bn - spent $45bn on own shares and execs Negotiations are now underway to bail out the airlines. Delta announced today that it is going to cut 70% of its flights. They have asked for $50bn which, according to our calculation, is just $5bn more than $45bn they have spent on share buybacks and executive pay over the last five years. Bet they - and US taxpayers - wish they had sat on some of that cash. Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, has demanded that any US government bailout package come with \u201csignificant conditions\u201d that would not allow companies to \u201cenrich shareholders or pad executive bonuses\u201d. US airlines pushing for massive bailout gave $45bn to shareholders in five years Read more Nelson has outlined her plan on Twitter. We won\u2019t let this to look like the bank bailout of 2008, nor can you compare the two. The airline industry didn\u2019t cause the pandemic and money should come with significant conditions to help workers and keep planes flying, not enrich shareholders or pad executive bonuses. Sara Nelson (@FlyingWithSara) The airline industry is in crisis. A lot of people are asking what to do. We have a plan that starts with workers.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) NASDAQ UP 72.2% SINCE OUR GREAT 2016 ELECTION VICTORY! DOW UP 55.8%. The best is yet to come! December 23, 2019 Presidents usually avoid boasting about the stock market, aware that today\u2019s gains can be wiped out by tomorrow\u2019s events. It\u2019s a lesson Trump is learning the hard way. Covid-19 has now erased all the stock market gains of the Trump presidency. After his last speech, markets fell so hard they were temporarily stopped. Now they are open again and still falling. The Dow is now down 9%. Updated at 5.54pm GMT Facebook Twitter 5.21pm GMT 17:21 Up and falling Trading has resumed and the falls continue. Some are blaming it on Trump. Here\u2019s Dan Alpert, investment banker and credit bubble expert: Dan Alpert (@DanielAlpert) And that's it. @realDonaldTrump literally succeeded in tanking the market - shutting it down as it hits it circuit breaker limit loss. He actually did it...the very stable genius! https://t.co/VI2kColI1Z March 18, 2020 Facebook Twitter 5.05pm GMT 17:05 Markets closed down - again Trading has stopped again after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,660 points, or 7.8%, and the S&P 500 dropped over 7%. The indexes are down about 30% from their mid-February highs. Everything is falling today. Oil has plunged 15% to its lowest level in more than 18 years. Gold, usually a safe haven in times of panic, is down 1%. Looks like people want to cash out - they want to take their money and head for the hills until this blows over. Updated at 5.09pm GMT Facebook Twitter 4.59pm GMT 16:59 \u201cShut it down now!\u201d Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is going off on CNBC. He sounds almost on the edge of tears. Says he has been in isolation recently because of fears he could carry the virus and pass it to older, vulnerable people including his dad. Ackman says he has never carried more than $200 in cash but went to the bank recently and took out \u201ca large amount of money\u201d. \u201cCapitalism does not work in an 18 month shutdown,\u201d he says. The Trump administration needs to close everything down in order to get rid of the virus as quickly as possible. \u201cThis is the only answer.\u201d If we don\u2019t jump on this now \u201cAmerica as we know it will end\u201d. Bill Ackman (@BillAckman) Mr. President, the moment you send everyone home for Spring Break and close the borders, the infection rate will plummet, the stock market will soar, and the clouds will lift. We need your leadership now! March 18, 2020 Facebook Twitter 4.43pm GMT 16:43 CEOs tell Trump to 'act boldly' America\u2019s biggest companies are weighing in - calling on Congress to \u201cact boldly\u201d to limit the economic fallout from the pandemic. The Business Roundtable, which speaks for dozens of major US companies including Apple, General Motors, JP Morgan Chase and WalMart, wants a suspension of global tariffs, a temporary halt to payrolls taxes and measures to support the supply chain. The government actions necessary to address this crisis will have enormous costs,\u201d the letter, signed by Walmart boss Doug McMillon, said. \u201cHowever, failure to act boldly now will impose far greater costs to our country and our future.\u201d Updated at 5.52pm GMT Facebook Twitter 4.27pm GMT 16:27 European markets close down - US markets are still falling European markets are now closed after another bad day. In London the FTSE 100 fell over 4%, in Frankfurt the Dax dropped over 5% per cent and in Paris the Cac 40 was down by a similar margin.

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) the act \u201cis the primary source of Presidential authorities to expedite and expand the supply of resources from the US industrial base to support military, energy, space, and homeland security programs.\u201d The act authorizes the president to: require businesses to sign contracts or fulfill orders deemed necessary for national defense; allocate materials, services and facilities to national defense; and gives him greater control over scarce and/or critical materials. The act became law on September 8, 1950, in response to the start of the Korean War. Facebook Twitter 3.59pm GMT 15:59 Trump speaks We are waiting for Trump to speak. The White House is asking Congress for $500bn that would pay for two emergency payments to US taxpayers. According to the New York Times , which has seen a draft of the proposal: The Treasury Department proposal calls for the authority to send two $250 billion rounds of checks directly to American taxpayers, the first on April 6 and the second May 18. Payments would be fixed, and their size dependent on income and family size, the summary said.

When\nfirst joining the crypto world, most users make their first\npurchase on centralized exchanges, where security and\nprivacy are far from guaranteed.

This inconvenience is why Infinito has\nworked with the leading fiat gateway platform Simplex to\ngive users a single place to buy then protect their crypto\nassets, while removing unwanted transaction fees when\nsending money back and forth between wallet and\nexchange. About this collaboration, Simplex Team\nshared: \"We are happy to support our partners Infinito with\nthis special offer to help boost global crypto adoption.\nBuying crypto with debit and credit cards has never been\neasier\". \"Thanks to the strategic partnership with\nSimplex, our users can now purchase Bitcoin and other top\ncryptocurrencies using their everyday credit card at great\nprice. With this integration, Infinito Wallet can offer the\nmost complete crypto experience for investors: buy their\nfirst coin, track market price, exchange, use their crypto\nto earn more with DApps, and soon, stake to earn passive\nincome directly on the wallet. We're very pleased to\ncollaborate with an industry leader like Simplex to bring\nvaluable crypto services to users worldwide,\" says Jack\nNguyen, Director of Infinito. After Simplex, Infinito Wallet\nplans to integrate with regional fiat gateway and exchange\nservices to better serve local users in Southeast\nAsia. As a special promotion for this integration,\nfrom February 14th to 27th, users can enjoy a 50% discount\non service fee when using the wallet's Buy Crypto\nfeature. About Simplex Simplex is\nproviding the fiat infrastructure for the crypto world. An\nEU licensed financial institution, Simplex processes credit\ncard payments with a 100% zero chargeback guarantee.\nUtilizing cutting-edge proprietary fraud prevention solution\nand AI systems, Simplex blocks fraudulent users and allows\nlegitimate ones to complete payments, thereby, increasing\nconversion rates and enabling merchants to focus on their\nown business growth. About Infinito\nWallet Infinito Wallet is a secure multi-crypto\nwallet that lets users easily start investing and earning\nmore with digital assets.

Now, Taxoshi\u2019s Founder and Technical Lead,\nCraig MacGregor, is following in Satoshi\u2019s footsteps by\nlaunching https://taxoshi.com/ , a\nsolution that will streamline the increasingly complicated\nprocess of filing tax returns for anyone in the crypto\necosystem, from one-off traders to career miners. The\nIRD has recently released a wealth of guidance making it\nclear that income from crypto is not immune to tax\nobligations. The process for calculating tax for the\nsale of cryptocurrencies, which the IRD considers personal\nproperty held on revenue account, can be incredibly\ncomplicated. \u201cA lot of people are\ndabbling without knowing the consequences. If you only have\none transaction of one currency establishing your cost base\nwhen you sell the gain/loss calculation is easy, but when\nyou have multiple transactions between crypto and fiat\ncurrencies it can get very complex, very quickly. says Scott\nMason, a crypto accountancy tax specialist and a Managing\nPartner of FINDEX, a large Australasian accountancy\nfirm. \u201cHaving a simple model that takes\nthat into account has to be a god-send from the compliance\nperspective.\u201d MacGregor was trying to calculate his\nown crypto tax obligations and quickly found himself\ncreating an entire software solution to tackle the\ncomplexity. \u201cI realised that I had to share this\nwith the wider crypto-community and Taxoshi was born. IRD\nestimates 25,000 to 100,000 crypto users who have a tax\nobligation in New Zealand,\u201d MacGregor\nsays. \u201cAccountancy information is fragmented and\nonly just coming into focus as IRD has released new\nguidance, but even this guidance is incredibly\ncomplicated. \u201cTaxoshi is the only platform that is\nNew Zealand specific and we plan to work with more\nregulators to roll out globally in the future. Plus offering\ncalculations of mining revenue and other advanced ways to\nearn money on blockchain and exchanges. \u201cAs the\nunderstanding of the space grows, more people will be\nlooking to get on the ladder. Taxoshi offers a streamlined\nand easy way for them to stay tax\ncompliant.\u201d \u201cCryptocurrency is supported by\ninnovative technology and Taxoshi is a useful service that\nwe recommend to our clients for a comprehensive review of\ntheir tax situation\u201d, says Janine Grainger, Co-Founder of\nKiwi cryptocurrency retailer Easy Crypto. \u201cIt complements\nwhat Easy Crypto does in terms of making things simple,\nstreamlined and easy for\ncustomers.\u201d \u00a9 Scoop Media Join the Scoop Citizen Community 20 years of independent publishing is a milestone, but your support is essential to keep Scoop thriving.

This is the\nprediction from Nigel Green, the CEO and founder of deVere\nGroup, one of the world\u2019s largest independent financial\nadvisory and services organisations. It comes as the\nBitcoin price has surged around 12 per cent over the last\nweek and 6 per cent Monday \u2013 outperforming almost all the\nmajor indices. It also comes ahead of only the\nthird-ever Bitcoin halving event in May. The supply of\nBitcoin \u2013 the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market\ncapitalisation - is limited to 21 million units, no more\nthan that amount can ever exist. Every four years, in\nwhat\u2019s known as \u2018halving\u2019, less and less Bitcoin will\nbe mined. In 2012, the number of new Bitcoins issued\nevery 10 minutes fell from 50 to 25. In 2016, it went down\nfrom 25 to 12.5. Now, in the 2020 halving, it will drop from\n12.5 to 6.25. Mr Green observes: \u201cHistory teaches us\nthat there is typically a considerable Bitcoin price surge\nresulting from halving events due to the dramatically lower\nsupply with steady demand and increasing\nawareness. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to believe the 2020\nhalving will be any different.\u201d He continues:\n\u201cWhilst halving events have previously generated major\nBitcoin price runs, I believe that other key drivers will\nhave a more significant, longer-term impact on the price of\nthe digital currency. \u201cThese include that we\u2019re\nmoving towards an era of zero interest rates. This reduces\nthe incentive to keep fiat currency. In addition, rate cuts\ntypically lead to higher inflation, which reduces the\npurchasing power of traditional\ncurrencies. \u201cTherefore, Bitcoin, and other\ndecentralised cryptocurrencies, become more attractive and\nthe price will adjust upwards accordingly.\u201d The CEO,\nwho launched the pioneering deVere Crypto app in early 2018,\ngoes on to say that the current coronavirus pandemic will\nalso play a significant role in supporting Bitcoin\nprices. \u201cIn this time of economic turbulence, the\ngrowing consensus that Bitcoin is becoming a\nflight-to-safety asset has further strengthened,\u201d he\nnotes. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018digital gold\u2019 status is being\ngalvanised,\u201d he affirms referencing the often-used\ncomparison due to precious metal and the cryptocurrency\nsharing key characteristics, including being a store of\nvalue and scarcity.\u201d In addition, he points out that\nBitcoin was born in the 2008-2009 financial crisis as global\nanger and disillusionment grew with traditional financial\ninstitutions. \u201cIt can be expected this financial\ndownturn will also encourage people to buy cryptocurrencies\nand develop crypto-orientated businesses.\u201d Mr Green\ngoes on to say: \u201cCombined with the fact that Bitcoin and\nother cryptocurrencies are digital and global, and the world\nis becoming increasingly digitalised and globalised; that\ndemographic trends are on its side; and that institutional\ninvestors, central banks and major corporations are all\ncoming off the sidelines, the long-term trajectory is\ninevitably upwards.\u201d The deVere CEO concludes:\n\u201cHalving is likely to have a significant, positive impact\non Bitcoin\u2019s price, but it is real-world issues and\nadoption that will drive prices exponentially and\nsustainably.\u201d \u00a9 Scoop Media Join the Scoop Citizen Community 20 years of independent publishing is a milestone, but your support is essential to keep Scoop thriving.

Plus offering calculations of mining revenue and other advanced ways to earn money on blockchain and exchanges. \u201cAs the understanding of the space grows, more people will be looking to get on the ladder. Taxoshi offers a streamlined and easy way for them to stay tax compliant.\u201d \u201cCryptocurrency is supported by innovative technology and Taxoshi is a useful service that we recommend to our clients for a comprehensive review of their tax situation\u201d, says Janine Grainger, Co-Founder of Kiwi cryptocurrency retailer Easy Crypto. \u201cIt complements what Easy Crypto does in terms of making things simple, streamlined and easy for customers.\u201d Content Sourced from scoop.co.nz Original url Scoop readers - Help to support quality, independent news & journalism that is freely available to the public.

In response, Trump baselessly claimed Wednesday that social media platforms \"totally silence\nconservatives' voices\" and threatened to \"strongly regulate,\nor close them down, before we can ever allow this to\nhappen.\" \"This will be a Big Day for Social Media and\nFAIRNESS!\" Trump tweeted Thursday, apparently referring to his executive\norder. \"There are important reasons to\nrestructure the law to make the web more open and free, but\nthis executive order is a\ndistraction.\" \u2014Sarah Miller, American\nEconomic Liberties Project Gaurav Laroia,\nsenior policy counsel at advocacy group Free Press, condemned the order as \"a naked attempt by the president to bully into\nsilence Twitter, other social-media sites and anyone who\nattempts to correct or criticize Trump.\" \"Trump's\nthreat to use the executive branch's power to punish\ninternet companies for Twitter's mild fact check of his\nstatements is exactly the kind of abuse of power that the\nConstitution and our First Amendment were written to\nprevent,\" Laroia said in a statement. \"It's undoubtedly the\nfirst step down an increasingly dark path of Trump using the\npower of his office to intimidate media companies,\njournalists, activists and anyone else who criticizes him\ninto silence.\" Laroia said that Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act was \"written to protect free\nspeech on the open internet.\" \"Changing Section 230 is\nCongress' prerogative, not the president's by fiat,\" said\nLaroia. \"His poorly written executive order is an\nembarrassment and would be laughable if it weren't so\ndangerous.\" Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight\nFirst Amendment Institute at Columbia University, tweeted\nthat \"whatever else this executive order may be, it is not a\ngood faith effort to protect free speech online.\" Sarah\nMiller, executive director of the American Economic\nLiberties Project, said in a statement that while there are\nimportant discussions to be had about the outsize power of\nsocial media companies and the implications for free\nexpression, Trump's executive order \"is a silly distraction\nfrom a serious debate.\" \"There are important reasons\nto restructure the law to make the web more open and free,\"\nsaid Miller, \"but this executive order is a distraction and\nwe should all have learned to ignore distractions like this\nfrom Trump by\nnow.\" \u00a9 Scoop Media Join the Scoop Citizen Community 20 years of independent publishing is a milestone, but your support is essential to keep Scoop thriving.
